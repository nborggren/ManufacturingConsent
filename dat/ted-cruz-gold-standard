"It's overrated how much how they drift toward personality. At the end of the day, it's really where the candidates are on policy." </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">The wonky outside spenders are the latest addition to the fold of overlapping, at times diverging, groups trying to spend big money to support Cruz independently. But it is the first Cruz group dedicated to issue spending, which several presidential candidates have used to give an extra boost to their primary bids. </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">The group does not appear to have the blessing of the Cruz campaign in Houston, which Danker said he has had no contact with since launching. </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">"They would probably be most comfortable not having to worry about what I'm doing," said Danker, explaining why he didn't seek the permission of Cruz aides. "I wanted to sort of do things that would lead the campaign in the direction of emphasizing their economic message and showing them it can work."  </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">The Cruz campaign did not respond to requests for comment. </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"><a href="http://www.cnn.com/2015/12/21/politics/ted-cruz-super-pac-ad-hits-rubio/index.html">Read: Cruz super PAC ad knocks Rubio</a></div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">But the founders are no strangers to Cruz circles. Danker met privately with Cruz for an hour last year when managing the New Jersey Senate race of Republican Jeff Bell, and he is a close associate of Sean Rushton, Cruz's top economic adviser, who Danker says inspired him to set up a group like Lone Star.</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">The group, which Danker said raised about $100,000 in the first week, is budgeting toward a $1 million buy focused almost entirely in New Hampshire, where Cruz has climbed but still remains solidly behind Donald Trump, who has led polls there for months. It's hired a North Carolina fundraiser, Jay Rao, to collect big checks. And they're planning to have a rapid-response arm dedicated to what they say will be feverish attacks on Cruz's contentious backing of the gold-tied dollar. </div><div class="el__embedded el__embedded--standard"><div class="el__gallery--standard js__gallery--standard js__leafmedia--gallery"><div class="js__gallery__close--standard el__gallery__close--standard el__storyelements--close"></div><div class="el__gallery--teaseimage"><div class="el__resize"><div class="el__position media js-gallery-aspect-ratio-wrapper"><img class="media__image media__image--responsive media__image--cut-format" alt="2015: The year in politics" data-src-mini="http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/151208171702-01-year-in-politics-2015-restricted-small-169.jpg" data-src-xsmall="http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/151208171702-01-year-in-politics-2015-restricted-medium-plus-169.jpg" data-src-small="http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/151208171702-01-year-in-politics-2015-restricted-large-169.jpg" data-src-medium="http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/151208171702-01-year-in-politics-2015-restricted-exlarge-169.jpg" data-src-large="http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/151208171702-01-year-in-politics-2015-restricted-super-169.jpg" data-src-full16x9="http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/151208171702-01-year-in-politics-2015-restricted-full-169.jpg" data-src-mini1x1="http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/151208171702-01-year-in-politics-2015-restricted-small-11.jpg"  data-demand-load="not-loaded" data-eq-pts="mini: 0,  xsmall: 221,  small: 308,  medium: 461,  large:  781" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhEAAJAJEAAAAAAP///////wAAACH5BAEAAAIALAAAAAAQAAkAAAIKlI+py+0Po5yUFQA7" data-cut-format="16:9"><div class="img__preloader"></div><noscript><img alt="2015: The year in politics" class="media__image" src="http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/151208171702-01-year-in-politics-2015-restricted-large-169.jpg"></noscript><div class="media__icon icon-media-gallery"></div></div></div><div class="js-media__caption media__caption el__storyelement__title"><div class="element-raw appearance-standard"><span class=el__storyelement__header> 97 photos:</span> <span class=el__storyelement__gray>2015: The year in politics</span></div></div></div><div class="el-carousel__wrapper"><div class=" js-owl-carousel owl-carousel carousel--full body" data-galleryname="2015: The year in politics" data-cut-format="16:9" data-is-gallery="true" data-slide-count="97"><div data-slidename="2015: The year in politics" data-analytics="_body_image"><div class="el__resize"><div class="el__position media js-gallery-aspect-ratio-wrapper"><img class="media__image media__image--responsive media__image--cut-format" alt="John Boehner kisses House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi after &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;http://www.cnn.com/2015/01/06/politics/house-speaker-boehner-vote/index.html&amp;quot;

When the University of Chicago asked 40 leading economists three years ago if Americans' lives would improve with a gold standard, not a single one said yes. </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">"This is the most idiotic idea I have ever heard from a presidential candidate.

But the other big campaign spender that is choosing to file with the IRS, a nonprofit supporting Marco Rubio, Conservative Solutions Project, has been criticized by Republican rivals and campaign finance reformers for hiding the names of people with a large influence on the political process. </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph"><a href="http://www.cnn.com/2015/12/20/politics/ip-cruz-sec-tailgate/index.html">Read: The flaw in Cruz's SEC strategy: No football tailgates?</a></div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">In some ways, Lone Star will suffer the worst of both worlds: The group would not be able to spend more than half of its money on federal express advocacy, said Jason Torchinsky, a Republican campaign finance attorney, even though it will still identify its donors. Danker defended the tax incorporation as the best option for an issue-based group, though he said it could reclassify as a super PAC in the future. </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">"Since
