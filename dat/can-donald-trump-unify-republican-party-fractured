<p>CHRIS WALLACE, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: &nbsp;I’m Chris Wallace. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>Growing violence at Trump rallies amid accusations the frontrunner's rhetoric plays a role. &nbsp;Today, we'll ask Donald Trump if he's responsible. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p> 
<p>WALLACE: &nbsp;Trump is forced to cancel a rally Chicago after hundreds of protesters show up to disrupt it. &nbsp;</p>
<div></div> 
<p>DONALD TRUMP, R-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: &nbsp;When they have organized, professionally staged wise guys, we've got to fight back. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>WALLACE: &nbsp;And Trump's rivals pin some of the blame on him. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>SEN. MARCO RUBIO, R-FLA., PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: &nbsp;Last night in Chicago, we saw images to make America look like a third world country. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>SEN. TED CRUZ, R-TEXAS, PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: &nbsp;In any campaign, responsibility starts at the top. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>WALLACE: &nbsp;We'll sit down with Trump to discuss the violence and what he'll try do to stop it. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>And we'll ask our Sunday if the protests will affect the Republican race. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>Then, the GOP campaign reaches a turning point as the primaries turn winner take all. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>In Ohio, Governor John Kasich battles to hold on to his home state. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>GOV. JOHN KASICH, R-OHIO, PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: &nbsp;When I win here on Tuesday, it's a whole new ball game. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>WALLACE: &nbsp;We'll talk with Kasich as he tries to stay alive in this campaign. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>And our power player of the week: giving millennials the news in six-second chunks. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: &nbsp;There was a large part of America that was being ignored. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>WALLACE: &nbsp;All right now on &quot;Fox News Sunday.&quot;</p> 
<p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p> 
<p>WALLACE: &nbsp;And hello again from Fox News in Washington. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>This was the scene at a Donald Trump campaign rally Ohio yesterday -- Secret Service agents rushing to protect the Republican front-runner after a protester jumped a fence and charged the stage. &nbsp;The concern was understandable, with growing protests and even violence at Trump campaign events. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>All this as the GOP race reaches a potential turning point. &nbsp;Five states go to the polls Tuesday, including Florida and Ohio -- both winner-take-all, and the home states for Marco Rubio and John Kasich. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>In a few minutes, we'll sit down with Governor Kasich who says he'll drop out if he loses Ohio. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>But, first, Donald Trump live from Chicago. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>Mr. Trump, welcome back to &quot;Fox News Sunday.&quot;</p> 
<p>TRUMP: &nbsp;Thank you. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>WALLACE: &nbsp;Even before you had to cancel your rally in Chicago on Friday, there had been growing violence at some of your rallies around the country. &nbsp;And some of the rivals, some of your rivals in the Republican race, say you have contributed to this with your rhetoric. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>Question, sir: do you take any responsibility for the violence at your rallies? &nbsp;</p> 
<p>TRUMP: &nbsp;First of all, I disagree totally, Chris, with what you said. &nbsp;I have by far the biggest crowds, 25,000, 30,000 people. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>Last week, we had in Alabama, 35,000 people. And out of that, we'll have some disrupters, sometimes put there by other people. &nbsp;But we’ll have some protesters. &nbsp;And nobody's been hurt at all. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>And as big as the rallies are, nobody's ever been hurt. &nbsp;We talk and we try and be good. &nbsp;I will tell you, some of the protesters are very rough and they’re bad dudes, and they swing and they punch, and nobody ever talks about that in the media. &nbsp;If other people including the police, because it's usually the police that handle it, if they get a little bit rough because they have no choice, the next day at the newspaper, it’d say the police are rough.</p> 
<p>But we've had nobody hurt. &nbsp;And when you think about it, when I have 25,000 and 20,000 people very routinely, by far the biggest, and we have some protesters stand up, who do you know that's been hurt over the last number of months? &nbsp;Nobody. &nbsp;Nobody's been hurt. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>WALLACE: &nbsp;Sir, let's take one example. &nbsp;First of all, we've been running video that shows a number of punches being thrown. &nbsp;I don't know that people have ended up being hospitalized.</p> 
<p>Let's take one example. &nbsp;On Wednesday in North Carolina, a protester named Rakeem Jones was being peacefully escorted from the event -- I’m not saying he didn't do something provocative. &nbsp;Yes, you can see he flips off a crowd, but then a man in the crowd elbows him in the face, knocks him to the ground. &nbsp;Here's what the man says afterwards --</p> 
<p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p> 
<p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: &nbsp;Yes, he deserved it. &nbsp;The next time we see him, we might have to kill him. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p> 
<p>WALLACE: &nbsp;Mr. Trump, does that have any place in America? &nbsp;</p> 
<p>TRUMP: &nbsp;No, it doesn't, and it's a shame that it happened. &nbsp;And I feel badly for everybody concerned. &nbsp;And we don't condone violence. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>But the kid did, from what I hear, stick up a certain finger right in everybody's face. &nbsp;And this man has had enough, because I'll tell you what, people in this country are very angry. &nbsp;They're angry at incompetent politicians, they’re angry at losing their jobs, not having a pay increase for 12 years and more effectively. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>Everything's -- this country is not -- we can't beat ISIS. &nbsp;Our military is going to hell. &nbsp;You look at what's going on with the vets, they're treated horribly. &nbsp;They’re worse than illegal immigrants. &nbsp;We have a big portion of this country that's fed up. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>You look at the Rust Belt and other areas of our country where jobs are being taken. &nbsp;They're all being moved down to Mexico and other locations. &nbsp;They're being moved out of the United States. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>We have a president that doesn't have a clue. &nbsp;He doesn't know what's going on. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>And the people of this country are angry. &nbsp;They're not angry people, but they're angry now. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>WALLACE: &nbsp;But you say and you just said again, you don't condone the violence. &nbsp;But, sir, the record is clear and we’re going to put up some tapes. &nbsp;You have condoned violence in rally after rally. &nbsp;Again, take a look. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p> 
<p>TRUMP: &nbsp;Just knock the hell -- I promise you, I will pay for the legal fees. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>I like to punch him in the face, I'll tell you. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>In the good old days, they'd rip him out of that seat so fast. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>There's a group out there, just throw them the hell out. &nbsp;That's OK. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p> 
<p>WALLACE: &nbsp;That sure sounds like condoning violence. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>TRUMP: &nbsp;Well, I’ll tell you what -- the one -- first one, I was told by Secret Service that there were two people in the audience, they couldn't find them, they didn't know where they were, but they had tomatoes and they were going chuck them at me. &nbsp;And maybe they had good arms, OK? &nbsp;And, you know, being hit in the face by a tomato is not exactly so good. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>So, before I saw them, in my speech, I said, folks, you have two people with tomatoes. &nbsp;If you see ‘em, do whatever you have to do to ‘em, I don't care. &nbsp;And you know what? &nbsp;I think I’m totally within my rights to say that.</p> 
<p>But everything I say -- in fact, if you play 99 percent of the clips, I’m always saying, don't hurt ‘em, take it easy. &nbsp;Don't hurt ‘em. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>And I’m saying that to the police who are really mistreated in this country, by the way. &nbsp;They're not appreciated for the great job they do. &nbsp;But, usually, it’s the police, it’s not my people, it's the police in the various municipalities that I go to. &nbsp;Honestly, they take -- they really take it easy. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>And again, Chris, with rallies of 25,000 and 35,000 people, you don't know of one injury in any of our rallies. &nbsp;And the one place where we could have had a problem was Chicago, and other than at your network, I’ve been given very, very good credit, very good credit for canceling, because if I would have had that -- we'll postpone it actually -- if I would have had that rally, you would have had a lot of problems. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>And those were professionals. &nbsp;I mean, those were real professionals. &nbsp;And they weren't protesters, they were disrupters. &nbsp;They were professional disrupters. &nbsp;They came in with the Bernie Sanders signs right out of his printing press. &nbsp;And they were disrupters. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>And I will tell you, though, Chris, with all of the -- with all of the rallies that you've been witnessing over many months, you haven't had one person that's even been hurt. &nbsp;And I’m sitting here listening to you tell me like, oh, like everybody's being maimed. &nbsp;It’s not that way. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>And I have often said, do not hurt him. &nbsp;You've heard me say that. &nbsp;You don't want to play those clips. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>WALLACE: &nbsp;All right. &nbsp;Let's move to another issue. &nbsp;You've also created a controversy this week with your comments about Islam. &nbsp;Here they are. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p> 
<p>TRUMP: &nbsp;I think Islam hates us. &nbsp;There's something -- there's something there -- there's a tremendous hatred there. &nbsp;There’s a tremendous hatred. &nbsp;We have to get to the bottom of it. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p> 
<p>WALLACE: &nbsp;Now, Mr. Trump, there are 1.6 billion Muslims in the world today, 1.6 billion. &nbsp;And according to the best experts, think tanks around the world, they say at most, 100,000 people are fighting for jihadist causes. &nbsp;That’s less than -- it’s a tiny fraction of 1 percent. &nbsp;So, why draw a battle line against an entire religion, including major countries that are helping us in the fight against ISIS? &nbsp;</p> 
<p>TRUMP: &nbsp;You're saying that out of 1.5 billion, 100,000, right -- let me tell you, whoever did that survey was about as wrong as you can get. &nbsp;It's 27 percent, could be 35 percent, would go to war, would -- the hatred is tremendous, Chris. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>Now, look -- &nbsp;</p> 
<p>(CROSSTALK)</p> 
<p>WALLACE: &nbsp;Wait, wait, you're saying 250 -- you're saying 250 -- 300 million Muslims would go to war against us? &nbsp;</p> 
<p>TRUMP: &nbsp;Why don’t you -- why don't you take a look at the Pew poll that came out very recently or fairly recently, where I think the number -- I mean, I could be corrected, it's whatever it is it is -- but it's something like 27 percent are, you know, really very militant about going after things. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>And you'll have to look at it. &nbsp;They did a very strong study. &nbsp;And let's see what it says. &nbsp;But it's a very significant number. &nbsp;It's not 100,000 people, I can tell you that. &nbsp;It's a ridiculous number. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>But, look, there's something going on, Chris, when like it or not. &nbsp;It would be easier for me to say, &quot;Oh, no, everybody loves us.&quot; &nbsp;</p> 
<p>But there’s something going on. &nbsp;There's a big problem. &nbsp;And radical Islamic terrorism is taking place all over the world. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>You look at what happened in Paris, you look at what happened in California recently with the 14 people killed by co-workers, by people where they gave ‘em baby showers and then they walk in and they kill ‘em, they shoot ‘em. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>They had no guns, they had no weapons. &nbsp;They had no nothing. &nbsp;They shot them. &nbsp;They killed them all. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>And -- I mean, there's something going on, Chris. &nbsp;We can be very nice and very naive and say everything's wonderful. &nbsp;All you have to do is look all over the world. &nbsp;There's a great hatred out there. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>WALLACE: &nbsp;You also said this about the war on ISIS --</p> 
<p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p> 
<p>TRUMP: &nbsp;We have to knock out ISIS. &nbsp;We have to knock the hell out of ‘em. &nbsp;I would listen to the generals, but I would -- I’m hearing numbers of 20,000 to 30,000. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p> 
<p>WALLACE: &nbsp;Which generals have told you, sir, that we need 20,000 to 30,000 U.S. ground troops in Iraq and Syria? &nbsp;</p> 
<p>TRUMP: &nbsp;Well, that's where I heard the number. &nbsp;That doesn't mean I do that, by the way. &nbsp;But that's what I heard the number is in order to eradicate. &nbsp;And it could be quick. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>You know, maybe we should do something quickly because this cancer is staying with us forever. &nbsp;I mean, we've been fighting in the Middle East now for 15 years and longer --</p> 
<p>WALLACE: &nbsp;But all the generals we've talked to say that’s --</p> 
<p>TRUMP: &nbsp;-- and we’ve been spending money at a rate -- and, Chris, in the meantime, our infrastructure in our country is going to hell, our country is in trouble. &nbsp;And all we do is spend money in the Middle East. &nbsp;I mean, either eradicate ‘em or get out. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>I mean, what we're doing is crazy. &nbsp;We don’t have any capability. &nbsp;It's ridiculous. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>(CROSSTALK)</p> 
<p>WALLACE: &nbsp;But all the generals that I’ve spoken to say 20,000 to 30,000 -- I mean, yes, we may need more troops, we may need forward observers, we may need people, special forces to help, Iraqi ground troops. &nbsp;But putting 20,000 to 30,000 American troops back in Iraq and Syria, they have grave doubts about that, sir. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>TRUMP: &nbsp;I’m not saying do, it I’m saying that's a number I heard you would need. &nbsp;And I never said, do it, I said that's the number you may need. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>But, look, let me tell you something, I whether you like it or not, I was against the war in Iraq, OK? &nbsp;I’m one that said, don't go in. &nbsp;You're going to destabilize the Middle East. &nbsp;I was totally right about that. &nbsp;So, I’m not like this big war hawk. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>Bu now, you have people chopping off heads, you have people drowning 40 and 50 people in steel cages at a time, Chris, and now, we have to do something. &nbsp;And the reason we have to do it is because of the power of weaponry. &nbsp;They're looking to get weapons, and they're looking to acquire weapons that are going to be very, very horrible for our country if they ever do it. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>WALLACE: &nbsp;Mr. Trump -- &nbsp;</p> 
<p>TRUMP: &nbsp;And we have to eradicate these people. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>WALLACE: &nbsp;I have two final questions I want to ask you. &nbsp;Trump University, I don't have to tell you, has become something of an issue on the campaign trail with some former students saying it's a scam. &nbsp;Here was one of them. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p> 
<p>BOB, RETIREE/TRUMP UNIVERSITY VICTIM: &nbsp;I was trumped by Trump. &nbsp;I was duped by the Donald. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p> 
<p>WALLACE: &nbsp;But you put out a video this week in which you showed that same man's report card about Trump University. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p> 
<p>TRUMP: &nbsp;Here's his report card on the school. &nbsp;Quality of presentation, quality of everything -- excellent, excellent, excellent, excellent, all excellents, 100 percent. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p> 
<p>WALLACE: &nbsp;But now, The New York Times reports that that man, Robert Guillo, says that he was pressured to give the report card grades, the excellents, by his instructors who said he'd be fired if he didn't give ‘em, and &quot;The Times&quot; talked to other students who say they came under pressure to give you good reports. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>TRUMP: &nbsp;Oh, really? &nbsp;And they did that with 10,000 people? &nbsp;</p> 
<p>Let me just tell you, this is a law firm. &nbsp;It's a class-action firm. &nbsp;They sue a lot of people. &nbsp;They're trying to get money -- I don't settle cases. &nbsp;I will go to -- I will go to court all day long with this case. &nbsp;Almost everybody in there has given report card saying it was excellent. &nbsp;We have an &quot;A&quot; from the Better Business Bureau, and you didn't report it on the show, in the debate. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>You did something very dishonest. &nbsp;You didn't report it. &nbsp;You told me and you told the world watching the debate that we had a D --</p> 
<p>WALLACE: &nbsp;Sir --</p> 
<p>TRUMP: &nbsp;And we didn't have a D. &nbsp;We had an A --</p> 
<p>(CROSSTALK)</p> 
<p>TRUMP: &nbsp;Excuse me.</p> 
<p>WALLACE: &nbsp;You know as well as I do, I didn't ask the question. &nbsp;And --</p> 
<p>TRUMP: &nbsp;I’m not talking about you, I’m talking about Fox. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>WALLACE: &nbsp;OK. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>TRUMP: &nbsp;I gave you the report card. &nbsp;I gave you the A during the debate because they said it was a D. &nbsp;And it was an A. &nbsp;And I gave you the A from Better Business Bureau --</p> 
<p>WALLACE: &nbsp;But don't you think you have the responsibility to check it out, to find out what's going on? &nbsp;And the fact is, it's a little more complicated than that, because Trump University has been out of business for several years. &nbsp;They're not getting so many complaints --</p> 
<p>TRUMP: &nbsp;It's not out of business. &nbsp;It's not out of business. &nbsp;It's suspended until after I win the lawsuit. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>WALLACE: &nbsp;OK.</p> 
<p>TRUMP: &nbsp;And after I win the lawsuit, hopefully, I'll be in the White House, and I’ll have my kids, you know, my kids will open it up --</p> 
<p>(CROSSTALK)</p> 
<p>WALLACE: &nbsp;But I promise you if Marco Rubio gave us a piece of paper in the middle of the debate, we're not going to simply start reading that. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>TRUMP: &nbsp;Oh, I think you would, I think you would. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>Actually, here's the story -- you said Better Business Bureau gave me a D. &nbsp;I said that's wrong. &nbsp;I got -- during an intermission, I called in, they sent the A rating. &nbsp;I got an A rating from Better Business. &nbsp;I handed to Megyn Kelly, and they refused to put it on. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>That is not honest. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>WALLACE: &nbsp;I think it's just wanting to check the facts. &nbsp;But in any case, let me -- you'll like there last question, so bear with me on this. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>TRUMP: &nbsp;All right. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>WALLACE: &nbsp;Because for all of the controversy --</p> 
<p>TRUMP: &nbsp;I’ll love it --</p> 
<p>WALLACE: &nbsp;I promise you, you will. &nbsp;Here, you can tell me afterwards when you like this question. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>TRUMP: &nbsp;All right.</p> 
<p>WALLACE: &nbsp;For all the controversies, you are doing very well now. &nbsp;You have a solid lead in the delegates. &nbsp;And as you pointed out, turnout is up considerably. &nbsp;There's a 67 percent increase in votes in Republican contest over 2012, up 67 percent. &nbsp;Twenty-three percent down in Democratic turnout compared to 2008. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>You say that you have been leading a movement. &nbsp;And I want to, briefly -- we have less than a minute -- explore that with you. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>What's the movement? &nbsp;What do these people want, and as what are the chances that you could effectively lock up this race on Tuesday? &nbsp;</p> 
<p>Now, wasn't that a nice question? &nbsp;</p> 
<p>TRUMP: &nbsp;I think -- I like that question. &nbsp;I like the statement, too. &nbsp;I’m glad we're finishing with this. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>Look, people have been disenfranchised in this country, great people, phenomenal people, people that have built this country. &nbsp;They’ve been totally disenfranchised. &nbsp;Trade deals have taken away their jobs all over. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>Our military can’t beat ISIS. &nbsp;Our veterans are being treated horribly. &nbsp;Our health care is horribly with Obamacare, where premiums are going up like nobody’s ever seen before, 45 percent, 55 percent. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>There's so many things wrong with our country and I’m going to straighten it out. &nbsp;And people understand that. &nbsp;We're going straighten it out and we’re going to make America great again. &nbsp;And that's what it's all about. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>And there's never been, they say, in the history of this country what's happening right now. &nbsp;And, by the way, it's been very friendly with no injuries, no injuries -- listen to you, it's like everybody, like it's a rampage. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>There's been no injuries, Chris. &nbsp;Remember that. &nbsp;No injuries. &nbsp;We did a good job by postponing the other day in Chicago. &nbsp;No injuries, Chris. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>WALLACE: &nbsp;Mr. Trump, thank you. &nbsp;Thanks for your time. &nbsp;And I hope you and all the people attending your rallies stay safe on the campaign trail, sir. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>TRUMP: &nbsp;Thank you very much. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>WALLACE: &nbsp;Up next, John Kasich on his must-win strategy for Ohio. &nbsp;Can he become the main establishment alternative to Trump? &nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
<p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p> 
<p>WALLACE: &nbsp;A look outside the beltway at Cleveland, Ohio. &nbsp;Tuesday is make-or-break for Ohio Governor John Kasich as he runs close in the polls with Donald Trump. &nbsp;Kasich has made it clear if he loses his home state, he'll drop out of the presidential race. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>He joins me now from Cleveland. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>And, Governor, welcome back. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>KASICH: &nbsp;Thanks. &nbsp;Thanks, Chris. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>WALLACE: &nbsp;I want to start with the growing violence at the trump rallies. &nbsp;You say that he has sowed seeds of division, and we're now seeing the fruits of that. &nbsp;You've called it a toxic environment. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>What does all of this say about the kind of president Donald Trump would be? &nbsp;</p> 
<p>KASICH: &nbsp;He's not going to be president. &nbsp;He's not going to have enough. &nbsp;I’m going win here in Ohio with the support of folks here who have seen their lives improve. &nbsp;More jobs, better wages, more hope, more people who have been ignored, who are getting attention. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>And that's going to be the end of it. &nbsp;He's not going to get to be the president of the United States. &nbsp;And, look --</p> 
<p>WALLACE: &nbsp;What about these rallies and his tenor at the rallies, sir? &nbsp;</p> 
<p>KASICH: Well, I just have to tell you, you can walk into a room, Chris, or an arena or wherever, and you can prey on the fears of people, or you can go in and give them hope. &nbsp;I go into my events and try to give them hope. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>When he goes and pits one group against another and says the reason this isn't good is because of that group, that's not helpful. &nbsp;And I think he has created a toxic environment. &nbsp;That doesn't mean that there aren't some people who have attended his rallies who are intent on causing trouble. &nbsp;But it's a mess. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>And, hopefully, it will settle down, and we can move beyond this. &nbsp;The last debate was far more civil than the ones before. &nbsp;And maybe they're catching on to the fact that being positive may be the best way to run a campaign for president. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>For me, I’m going to run -- I’m not going to take the low road to the highest office in the land. &nbsp;And we're growing. &nbsp;We're doing well in Ohio. &nbsp;We're doing well in other states. &nbsp;We're going to be very competitive. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>And, Chris, don't be surprised if I go with the strongest amount of delegates into the convention. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>WALLACE: &nbsp;All right. &nbsp;Let's talk about your path to the nomination. &nbsp;After you finished a strong second as but in New Hampshire, you talked about your pathway being through the industrial Midwest. &nbsp;But you suffered a disappointing performance. &nbsp;You finished third in Michigan last week. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>KASICH: &nbsp;Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. &nbsp;Don't try to characterize what I did in Michigan that way. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>WALLACE: &nbsp;Well, I --</p> 
<p>KASICH: &nbsp;I was about -- I was about 7 percent or 8 percent in Michigan and I finished with almost 25 percent of the vote --</p> 
<p>WALLACE: &nbsp;You and your campaign -- excuse me, sir, you and John Weaver both talked about winning Michigan in February. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>KASICH: &nbsp;OK. &nbsp;Chris, let me paint it for you. &nbsp;I was at about 7 percent or 8 percent. &nbsp;I split the number of delegates with Ted Cruz for second place, 43 percent of the late deciders voted for me. &nbsp;We came out of Michigan with momentum. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>There isn’t anybody who’s connected to the Kasich campaign that wasn't pleased with our finish in Michigan. &nbsp;&nbsp;And you know what, that's the problem when we try to be fortune tellers. &nbsp;I’m not going to be a fortune teller other than for Ohio which we're going to win. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>WALLACE: &nbsp;OK --</p> 
<p>KASICH: &nbsp;We are with --</p> 
<p>WALLACE: &nbsp;If I may, sir --</p> 
<p>KASICH: &nbsp;OK --</p> 
<p>WALLACE: &nbsp;No, but -- are you trailing at this point in Illinois. &nbsp;You're trailing in Missouri, and which raises the specific questions I want to ask you which is, even if you win Ohio, aren't you just a favorite son holding on to your home state? &nbsp;</p> 
<p>KASICH: &nbsp;Chris, we're rising in Illinois. &nbsp;There are going to be polls that come out that will show me in second place. &nbsp;It's a matter of accumulating delegates. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>And look, this -- for the last couple of weeks -- look, I don't want to be arguing about this. &nbsp;I didn't get any attention. &nbsp;When we had debates, there were people in the hall shouting my name to have me asked a question. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>Finally, I’m getting heard. &nbsp;Finally, the positive nature of the campaign is working. &nbsp;Finally, people are beginning to realize that when I was budget chairman we had economic growth by the scores. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>That in Ohio, we've turned this state around. &nbsp;That wages are up. &nbsp;We're up over 400,000 jobs. &nbsp;I’ve cut taxes more than anybody. &nbsp;And, finally, people are beginning to say, well, wait a minute, now I see who this guy is. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>So, just give us a chance. &nbsp;Most people never thought we'd -- most people never thought we'd get here. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>WALLACE: &nbsp;Governor Kasich, you're on the show today. &nbsp;We're very happy to have you here. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>I want to ask you -- I want to ask you about Marco Rubio because he has suggested to his supporters that to try to stop Donald Trump, maybe his supporters in Ohio should actually vote for you. &nbsp;Take a look. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p> 
<p>RUBIO: &nbsp;I have a voter in Ohio conclude that voting for John Kasich gives us the best chance to stop Donald Trump there. &nbsp;I anticipate that's what they'll do. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p> 
<p>WALLACE: &nbsp;Governor, following that same logic, should Kasich supporters in Florida support Rubio so he can beat Trump? &nbsp;It's winner-take-all, instead of splitting the anti-Trump vote? &nbsp;</p> 
<p>KASICH: &nbsp;Chris, I’m not out to stop anybody. &nbsp;I’m out to get myself elected. &nbsp;And so, this is not like a parlor game for me.</p> 
<p>Look, I’m not in Florida campaigning. &nbsp;I’m spending my time, I spent time in Illinois, I’m spending a lot of time in Ohio. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>But again, I don't want to spend time in the process. &nbsp;I want people to know that I have the foreign policy experience. &nbsp;I also have the domestic policy record to show that I can take both of them and become an effective leader of this country -- bring people together, improve their situation, begin to solve some of the frustrations they have with their income, with their kids' future. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>That's what I want to talk about. &nbsp;That's what we're talking about in Ohio. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>WALLACE: &nbsp;Let's talk about an issue and one of the biggest issues in the Midwest is trade. &nbsp;In the exit polls in Michigan, their last week, 55 percent of those voting in the GOP primary feel trade with other countries takes away jobs. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>But you're on record supporting trade deals. &nbsp;Here you are:</p> 
<p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p> 
<p>KASICH: &nbsp;I’m a free trader. &nbsp;I supported NAFTA. &nbsp;I believe in the PTT because it's important those countries in Asia are an interface against China. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p> 
<p>WALLACE: &nbsp;Governor, are you telling voters in Ohio that NAFTA and the Pacific Trade deal are good bargains, are good for the Ohio economy, and that Trump is wrong? &nbsp;</p> 
<p>KASICH: &nbsp;Yes. &nbsp;Well, first of all, simple fact is one out of every five Americans are connected to trade. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>I was just in a plant in Dayton, Ohio, where the Chinese invested a half a billion dollars in employing over 1,000, you know, Ohio workers. &nbsp;I was in a plant, invested by the Germans. &nbsp;We have lots of people investing in our state. &nbsp;That's why we're up over 400,000 jobs. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>Here's the thing, Chris -- it's not just free trade, it's fair trade. &nbsp;I’ve been saying all along that we need an expedited process. &nbsp;I said it in the debate, an expedited process, when people try to rip us off and hurt the American worker, I will move immediately to block their imports. &nbsp;And, in fact, in 2001, I helped to guarantee that the 2000 -- 2001 trade restraint so our steel companies could have a chance to breathe. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>Fair trade but -- free trade but fair trade. &nbsp;And I will act against trade violations. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>WALLACE: &nbsp;OK. &nbsp;Fox News has gotten a hold of a video of Hillary Clinton on a trip to India back in 2005 when she was a senator. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>She was asked about legislating, whether the U.S. might consider legislation to ban outsourcing. &nbsp;She said no, but the she added this --</p> 
<p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p> 
<p>HILLARY CLINTON, D-N.Y., THEN-U.S. SENATOR: &nbsp;Perhaps some economic incentives to at least think very hard before those decisions are made. &nbsp;But, you know, it is a -- an inevitability. &nbsp;There is no way to legislate against reality. &nbsp;So, I think that, you know, the outsourcing will continue. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p> 
<p>WALLACE: &nbsp;What do you think of then-Senator Clinton's comments? &nbsp;</p> 
<p>KASICH: &nbsp;Well, I think -- I think the point on outsourcing, and I have talked to at least one CEO who wanted to move some operations out of the U.S. into the United States -- and I made it clear to him that there's more than just profits. &nbsp;There has to be a value system that underlays our free enterprise system. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>And before people make a decision to move out, before a board of directors authorizes this, they better be careful that they are not going to absolutely begin to hurt the concept in Americans' minds about the process of trade. &nbsp;If I were on a board of the company and they wanted to go out there and outsource, they'd have to give me a very good reason as to why the survival of the company depended on it. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>But just to make a few more bucks is not something that I encourage as to how to make a law, you’d have it tell me what the specifics are. &nbsp;I’m open to anything that can put us in a position to protect the American worker, but at the same time not shutting down the blinds and locking the doors on our ability to dominate the world when it comes to economic activity which we do. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>WALLACE: &nbsp;Governor, I’ve got less than a minute left. &nbsp;You know as an old TV host how that works. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>KASICH: &nbsp;OK. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>WALLACE: &nbsp;I want to ask you -- I want to ask you about Common Core. &nbsp;In January, 2015, I asked you about other governors who had helped start Common Core but were now running away from it because of potential presidential campaigns. &nbsp;Here was your very strong defense then of Common Core --</p> 
<p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p> 
<p>KASICH: &nbsp;These were governors that helped create Common Core. &nbsp;Chris, the Common Core was written by state education superintendents and local principals. &nbsp;I’ve asked the Republican governors that have complain good this to tell me where I’m wrong. &nbsp;And guess what? &nbsp;Silence. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p> 
<p>WALLACE: &nbsp;But in the debate this week, you were asked once again to defend Common Core, and you never mentioned it. &nbsp;Here you are again. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p> 
<p>KASICH: &nbsp;Frankly, education has to be run at the school board level with a little guidance from the state. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p> 
<p>WALLACE: &nbsp;Let's clear this up, Governor. &nbsp;Do you still --</p> 
<p>KASICH: &nbsp;Yes --</p> 
<p>WALLACE: &nbsp;-- supported Common Core, and are you prepared to say that Common Core is not, as you said in 2015, is not a federal takeover? &nbsp;</p> 
<p>KASICH: &nbsp;OK, we only have a minute, Chris. &nbsp;Let me tell you, in our state, our state school board has adopted very high standards, and the curriculum is developed by local school boards.</p> 
<p>Plain and simple, you can call it anything you want to. &nbsp;At the end of the day, we set the standards, and the local school boards develop the curriculum, plain and simple. &nbsp;It's no more complicated than that. &nbsp;We don't take orders from anybody. &nbsp;We don't --</p> 
<p>WALLACE: &nbsp;Is that Common Core?</p> 
<p>KASICH: &nbsp;You're not going to get me to say -- Chris, you're not going to get me to start using names. &nbsp;I’m telling you that it's about high standards and local control, and we need high standards in America. &nbsp;So, our kids are trained for the jobs of the 21st century. &nbsp;And that’s exactly what we’re trying to do in Ohio.</p> 
<p>You're a good man. &nbsp;You’re a good man, Chris.</p> 
<p>WALLACE: &nbsp;Well, I’m not -- I’m not going to stop with you. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>Governor, thank you. &nbsp;Thanks for your time.</p> 
<p>(LAUGHTER)</p> 
<p>KASICH: &nbsp;See you, man.</p> 
<p>WALLACE: &nbsp;Always good to talk with you and good luck on Tuesday.</p> 
<p>KASICH: &nbsp;Always good. &nbsp;Always good. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>WALLACE: &nbsp;Up next, we'll bring in our Sunday group to discuss the disruptions and debate in the Republican race. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>Plus, what would you like to ask the panel about the violence at Trump rallies and whether he's responsible for it? &nbsp;Just go to Facebook or Twitter @FoxNewsSunday, and we may use your question on the air.</p> 
<p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p> 
<p>WALLACE: Hillary Clinton is asked about the possible fallout from the FBI investigation into her private e-mail server.</p> 
<p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p> 
<p>JORGE RAMOS, MODERATOR: If you get indicted, would you drop out?</p> 
<p>HILLARY CLINTON, D-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Oh, for goodness -- that is not going to happen. I’m not even answering that question.</p> 
<p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p> 
<p>WALLACE: &nbsp;We’ll ask our Sunday group how the Clinton e-mail scandal is affecting her campaign, coming up.</p> 
<p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p> 
<p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p> 
<p>TRUMP: I shouldn't say it, but I watched -- I watched little Marco and I watched lying Ted Cruz.</p> 
<p>RUBIO: I still, at this moment, continue to intend to support the Republican nominee, but it’s getting harder every day.</p> 
<p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p> 
<p>WALLACE: &nbsp;After a brief outburst of civility, the Republican race returned to the more customary, personal insults this weekend.</p> 
<p>And it’s time now for our Sunday group, GOP strategist Karl Rove, Julie Pace, who covers the White House and the campaign for the Associated Press, Kimberly Strassel from The Wall Street Journal, and Fox News political analyst Juan Williams.</p> 
<p>Well, we asked you for questions for the panel, and we got plenty this week about the violence at Trump rallies and whether or not he's responsible for it. Jenny sent this on Twitter, &quot;he specifically told them to punch people in the face. How is that not inciting violence?&quot; But Jean Cowburn wrote this on Facebook, &quot;Why are Ted and Marco pointing the finger at Donald? Do they always blame the victim?&quot;</p> 
<p>Karl, do you expect all of this, about the rallies, the violence, do you expect it to have any impact on the vote on Tuesday? And if so, and I ask this as a genuinely open question, will it help Trump or hurt him?</p> 
<p>KARL ROVE, GOP STRATEGIST: Well, I think it will tend to help him. Let's divorce this two, this question, put it into two parts. Moveon.org, Black Lives Matter and others who -- who have announced their desire to break up Trump rallies by organized demonstrations inside the halls. This is reprehensible behavior, worthy of the (INAUDIBLE) &nbsp;run by colonels in mirrored sunglasses. Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton and the leaders of the civil rights movement have a moral obligation to speak openly to these groups and discourage them from doing so. Do whatever you want outside the rallies. Do whatever you want to do outside the hall in a peaceful fashion. But to -- to have, as an organized aim, like the leader of moveon.org said, to get into these rallies and disrupt them is fundamentally un-American.</p> 
<p>On the other hand -- and I don't want to make these morally equivalent because I don't want it to be cause and effect -- Donald Trump's behavior at the rallies -- &quot;knock the crap out of them, will you? Seriously, just knock the hell -- I promise I will pay for the legal fees, I promise, I promise.&quot; I mean the declaration in his interview with you that he had a -- that people had a right to do this? He wants to be president of the United States.</p> 
<p>WALLACE: Talking about his supporters going after the protesters?</p> 
<p>ROVE: Right. Yes, and he wants to be president of the United States. What president had -- could you believe would indulge themselves in this kind of behavior?</p> 
<p>WALLACE: &nbsp;So why do you think it's going to help him?</p> 
<p>ROVE: Well, I think it’s going to help him because it -- people inside the Republican Party who support him say he's being a victim. And in a way he is. But he’s also responsible for setting a tone. He claims that he can be presidential if he wants to be. It is time for him now to be presidential and to -- and to -- and to recede from this moment. Let the Secret Service and local law enforcement move these people out, but treat everyone in that hall with respect and set a tone that is worthy of our great country.</p> 
<p>WALLACE: &nbsp;Kim?</p> 
<p>KIM STRASSEL, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL: Yes, no, I agree. I mean, but I also agree with Karl that this is probably going to help him, too, because you have to look at Donald Trump's supporters. And a lot of them, they love the fact that he's anti-PC. A lot of them believe that when people are out there calling him a fascist, it's because -- for instance, he’s anti-immigration. They don’t like the idea that somehow those two are somehow equated. And so when you have these kind of protests going on, I think it’s just going to strengthen the resolve of a lot of people to go out and vote for him. They feel as though that's the way you have to respond to these kinds of attacks.</p> 
<p>WALLACE: &nbsp;President Obama was asked this week whether or not he bears any responsibility for the political polarization surrounding Donald Trump's campaign. Not surprisingly, he said, no.</p> 
<p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p> 
<p>BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: But what I'm not going to do is to validate some notion that the Republican crackup that's been taking place is -- is -- is a consequence of actions that I've -- I’ve taken.</p> 
<p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p> 
<p>WALLACE: &nbsp;Julie, are they really oblivious at the White House to how polarizing -- not specifically to say Obama caused Trump, but how politically polarizing this president has been? And if they are divorcing themselves from Trump, how about the -- the political revolution that's taking place, the populist uprising surrounding Bernie Sanders?</p> 
<p>JULIE PACE, THE ASSOCIATED PRESS: I don't think they're oblivious to it. I mean you do hear the president, in other moments, talk about how his biggest regret of his presidency has been that he hasn't been able to fulfill promises he made in his 2008 campaign to bring Washington together.</p> 
<p>WALLACE: &nbsp;Yes, but, wait, because I heard him in that press conference and he blamed it all on the Republicans.</p> 
<p>PACE: Absolutely. I'm saying in other moments he does talk about how he bears responsible for not being able to bring Washington together. I think that when he looks at Republicans, though, when he especially looks at Donald Trump, one of the first things that comes to his mind is, during his first term, when Trump was pushing the birther movement. And a lot of Republican leaders -- I'm sure you did some of these interviews -- it was hard to get them to unequivocally state that Obama was born in the United States. That he was a legitimate president. So I think that when he looks at Trump, he looks at some -- something that through a different frame than necessarily what's happening on Capitol Hill, or the divisiveness that you might see in Washington.</p> 
<p>WALLACE: &nbsp;You know, there's also a race that's going to happen on Tuesday, a big race, a turning point because you've got five big delegate-rich states voting, and two of them, Florida and Ohio, in addition to being the home states of Rubio and Kasich, are also winner take all.</p> 
<p>Juan, if you see Trump winning one or both of those, in a practical sense --not mathematically, but effectively -- could he wrap up this nomination?</p> 
<p>JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS POLITICAL ANALYST: It’s hard, but it's possibly. And, clearly, he has the momentum now. If he wins both Ohio and Florida, though, keep in mind, Chris, he'd still need about 52 percent. So more than half of the remaining delegates. So it would be hard to say, he wraps it up.</p> 
<p>If he was to win, let’s say, Florida, but lose Ohio, he'd still need 59 percent of the remaining delegates. If he loses both, 69 percent of the remaining delegates. So that’s a lot.</p> 
<p>But, remember, beginning on Tuesday, we go into winner take all in several -- now the majority of these Republican states. That's a big advantage. So he could get a large share of delegates in a sweep. I was reading this week, Illinois, Missouri, two of the states that will vote on Tuesday, don't discount them, they've got a large pool of delegates, about 120. So if Trump does well there, it could offset a loss, let’s say, in Ohio, where Kasich, at the moment, leads in the polls.</p> 
<p>WALLACE: &nbsp;Karl, your -- your thoughts about what's at stake this Tuesday.</p> 
<p>ROVE: Well, Marco Rubio's candidacy, the viability of it is very much in question if he loses Florida. The viability of John Kasich's candidacy, which is poof if he loses Ohio. But let’s put this in perspective. This contest is likely to go on. Donald Trump today has 460 delegates. The non-Trump forces have 636. So he's got to pick up a net of 176 more delegates on Tuesday than his combined opposition has in order to take the lead.</p> 
<p>Now, we -- we -- we enter after this -- this is the period, March 1st, the ides of march. We can begin have winner-take-all contests from here on out. However, the majority of the delegates elected after Tuesday are going to be in proportional or what are called hybrid or winner-take-most states. So we -- we are likely to have a very contested pattern right up to the -- to the convention itself.</p> 
<p>In the debate, interesting comment. Trump said -- was -- all the candidates were asked, well, what happens if Trump -- if somebody goes into the convention with a lead. And Trump said, well, I ought to go in to -- he said, I think whoever gets to the top position, as opposed to solving that artificial number that by somebody, which is a very random number. Well, that's called a majority, 1,237.</p> 
<p>WALLACE: &nbsp;Yes. I (INAUDIBLE) that as well.</p> 
<p>ROVE: Yes. And -- and the fact of the matter is, is that we've had five of the 16 elected Republican presidents were not leading on the first ballot of the convention, including the sainted Abraham Lincoln, who was -- who was running third on the first two ballots and was nominate on the third. So this is likely to go.</p> 
<p>WILLIAMS: And what you hear -- what you hear from Republicans who are Trump backers is, there's going to be a great revulsion with the Republican establishment if Trump goes in leading anywhere close to having the necessary delegates, Karl, and if the establishment thwarts the will of the Republican voter.</p> 
<p>ROVE: The party will be bitterly divided in --</p> 
<p>STRASSEL: What will?</p> 
<p>ROVE: The party is likely to be bitterly divided almost no matter what the outcome is because if you go in and say, all right, I’m the guy who’s got 45 percent of the delegates, but I deserve to have the nomination no matter what, the other 55 percent are going to have a lot of angry people.</p> 
<p>WILLIAMS: The party --</p> 
<p>WALLACE: &nbsp;Right.</p> 
<p>WILLIAMS: The party has the trouble is in -- infraction (ph).</p> 
<p>WALLACE: &nbsp;We have to take a break here, but the good news is that we only have, what, about four more months to be discussing exactly this and all the various scenarios.</p> 
<p>Up next, both Democratic candidates condemn the violence at Trump rallies as they also deal with their own issue, like the Clinton e-mail scandal.</p>

<p>WALLACE: &nbsp;Democratic candidates Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders joining forces to attack Donald Trump for the violence at some of his recent rallies.</p> 
<p>And we’re back now with the panel.</p> 
<p>Well, let's talk some Democratic politics. Sanders won a close but still shocking victory over Clinton in Michigan this week. He says it will springboard him to the nomination.</p> 
<p>Karl, one, does it at all change the overall dynamic of the Democratic race? And, second, even if it doesn't, what does it reveal about potential vulnerabilities of Hillary Clinton in a general election?</p> 
<p>ROVE: Well, this really was a remarkable victory. And the Real Clear Politics average going into the debate, there was not a single poll showing Sanders ahead. And her lead in the Real Clear Politics average was 21.4 of all those polls that were being run right up to it. And he eked out a 1 percent victory. He got a bigger break in the delegates because his vote was spread more widely across the state. He got 63. She got 58.</p> 
<p>But, look, it does not change. It -- it allows us to have more entertainment and excitement on the Democratic contest going forward. There will be other -- other -- other instances where, in states with substantial white populations in Democratic primary, that he pulls off a victory. She will win -- like that night, she won Mississippi, 85-14, taking 29 delegates to his four. And --</p> 
<p>WALLACE: &nbsp;But doesn't it reveal some weaknesses?</p> 
<p>ROVE: Oh, absolutely. She -- this -- a systemic problem with her and the Democrats. John Judas wrote an interesting article last year saying the emerging Republican advantage. Blue collar people, working class people, are becoming unglued from the Democratic Party. And we're seeing that when they can't go for the Democratic frontrunner. However, look, this contest was over before it began because of the 712 super delegates. Seven hundred and sixty-six elected delegates for her, 551 for him. But among the unelected super delegates, the house of lords in the Democratic Party, it is 465 for her so far to 25 for him. And I understand they've got patrols out looking for those 25 and they are certainly (INAUDIBLE) --</p> 
<p>WALLACE: &nbsp;Been rounding them up.</p> 
<p>Then there is the FBI investigation into Hillary Clinton's private e-mail server. And we showed you during one of the breaks how she bristled when in the last debate Jorge Ramos even raised the question as to whether or not she would drop out if she were indicted.</p> 
<p>Kim, on the other hand, with no sign that a grand jury has even been empaneled to begin to hear evidence in this case, this is going to take months at the least, yes?</p> 
<p>STRASSEL: Well, we don't know. One of the most important things that came out this week was the news that Justice has supposedly given immunity to Brian Pagliano. This is the guy who maintained her server at her house. He also was a State Department employee.</p> 
<p>And, you know, I would argue that people have all kept focus on the national security question, whether she mishandled the classified information. But, you know, Fox itself reported last month that in fact the FBI is also investigating this question about whether or not there wasn't some unseemly interaction between her official duties at the State Department and all the work that was done at the Clinton Foundation. And they seem to be looking at this very widely. So will that potentially take a little bit more time? Maybe. But she could be on the hook for something far more than just classified information.</p> 
<p>WALLACE: &nbsp;There was another interesting moment in the Democratic debate this week when Hillary Clinton seemed to move well to the left of Barack Obama on immigration policy, when she in effect pledged that as president she would not deport any illegal immigrants in this country now unless they were violent criminals. Take a look at this exchange.</p> 
<p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p> 
<p>RAMOS: You would stop those deportation?</p> 
<p>CLINTON: I would stop --</p> 
<p>RAMOS: The deportations for children --</p> 
<p>CLINTON: Yes.</p> 
<p>RAMOS: And those who don't have a criminal record?</p> 
<p>CLINTON: Of our -- of the people, the undocumented people living in our country, I do not want to see them deported. I want to see them on a path to citizenship. That is exactly what I will do.</p> 
<p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p> 
<p>WALLACE: &nbsp;Julie, what do they make of that at the White House?</p> 
<p>PACE: Well, I mean, this is what of what we've seen happen with Hillary Clinton on a lot of issues in this Democratic primary and it's primarily the influence of Bernie Sanders, which is the Democratic Party has moved to the left and Bernie Sanders has really exposed that, broken that wide open. And if she sticks with some of the positions that she's had previously, even some of the positions that Barack Obama had, she's out of step with the majority of Democratic voters.</p> 
<p>I think if she becomes the nominee, there's potentially going to be a very important moment this summer if we do see a surge at the border, as we've seen in past years, where she's going to have to answer questions about what she would do with people who are coming across the border, young children coming across the border, families coming across the border. But, again, I think this speaks more to where the Democratic Party has moved and where Bernie Sanders has taken it than anything else.</p> 
<p>WALLACE: &nbsp;Juan, let's pick up on that. I mean I understand the politics of Clinton trying to fend off Sanders and also her desire to try to mobilize the Hispanic base in a general election. But when you say that you are pledging, as president, you will not deport any illegal immigrants -- I'm not talking about Donald Trump's roundup of 11 million people, no illegal immigrants unless they're violent criminals, first of all, is that legal? And, secondly, do you run -- run the risk of a backlash in a general election by some people who may say, you know, we do need to do something to enforce our borders?</p> 
<p>WILLIAMS: Well, clearly, Donald Trump has stirred tremendous passions in the country on the immigration issue. I think that's really the launching point for his campaign is this anti-immigrant passions. In the Latino community, nationwide, so I'm not just talking about in Florida where everybody is right now in terms of the political focus, but I'm talking nationwide, there is a revoltion (ph) among the Latino community, not only about the anti-immigrant tone of Trump's campaign, but anger at President Obama for his high level of deportation exceeding what took place under President Bush.</p> 
<p>WALLACE: &nbsp;But don't you think that a potential Republican candidate, where it's Trump or somebody else, is going to be able to say in a general election, really, you're not going to deport any illegal immigrant? The whole 11 or 12 or 14, whatever it is, they can all stay here if they haven’t committed a crime?</p> 
<p>WILLIAMS: I think the contrary position, Chris, would be to say, and exactly how do you plan to deport all these people? Are you going to line up buses? Do you have a real --</p> 
<p>WALLACE: &nbsp;President Obama’s deporting them right now.</p> 
<p>WILLIAMS: No, he’s deporting people -- he’s going after specific targeted groups --</p> 
<p>WALLACE: &nbsp;Right.</p> 
<p>WILLIAMS: At a very high rate --</p> 
<p>WALLACE: &nbsp;Right.</p> 
<p>WILLIAMS: That, as I say, discomforting the Latino community. So, one, in terms of political passion --</p> 
<p>WALLACE: &nbsp;Right, I'm just talking about continuing that.</p> 
<p>WILLIAMS: Well, I’m talking about in terms of political passions, I think the Democrats and especially Hillary Clinton feel the need to appeal to the Latino community on an issue that is number one in their minds. So I don’t -- they’re playing to that base. If you're asking about a subsequent backlash more generally, I don't see it, actually.</p> 
<p>ROVE: Look the -- what's involved here is a rule of law. The president of the United States has no authority to suspend the enforcement of our immigration laws in toto (ph) as Hillary Clinton proposed. And with all due respect, there's not one mind within the Latino community on this. You want to go down and talk to these mayors in the Rio Grande Valley, and they are irritated, angry it not people being deported, but not enough people being deported. And these are Latino mayors who understand that this influx of illegals, particularly children and families, is overrunning their social safety network.</p> 
<p>WALLACE: &nbsp;Thank you, panel. See you next Sunday.</p> 
<p>Up next, our &quot;Power Player of the Week.&quot; A political new startup finding different ways to attract readers and viewers.</p> 
<p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p> 
<p>WALLACE: &nbsp;It's no surprise technology is changing the way we get our news. But what can still be a shock is when millions of us now get that news from companies that didn't exist during the last presidential election. Here's our &quot;Power Player of the Week.&quot;</p> 
<p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p> 
<p>ALEX SKATELL, INDEPENDENT JOURNAL REVIEW: What we do better than anything is we help people experience the news. Show me versus tell me what's happening and I'll make the decision myself.</p> 
<p>WALLACE (voice-over): Alex Skatell is founder and CEO of Independent Journal Review, a four-year-old social media news company that targets millennials. It has found its audience. Thirty million different visitors a month, making it one of the top five news sites in the country.</p> 
<p>SKATELL: We have more Vine views than any other news organization in America, which are six-second news bytes of a story.</p> 
<p>WALLACE: &nbsp;It was IJR’s Vine on Trump's hands --</p> 
<p>TRUMP: But he said I had small hands. I've always had people say, Donald, you have the most beautiful hands. Actually, I'm 6'3&quot;, not 6’2&quot;, but he said I had small hands.</p> 
<p>WALLACE: &nbsp;And Trump and Cruz at the last Fox debate.</p> 
<p>TRUMP: Civil cases.</p> 
<p>CRUZ: Not complicated. Count to ten, Donald, count to ten.</p> 
<p>TRUMP: Give me a break. Give me a break.</p> 
<p>COUNT VON COUNT, &quot;SESAME STREET&quot;: One, two, three, four --</p> 
<p>SKATELL: When we think about the news coverage and the audience we're reaching, we want to create experiences for them which they value more than anything else. They want to feel like they're there.</p> 
<p>DAVID MUR, ABC NEWS: And the Independent Journal Review are honored to be here at Saint Anselm College in Manchester.</p> 
<p>WALLACE: &nbsp;When IJR co-sponsored a debate, they created a 360 experience so you could put yourself in the hall. They got ten million views for this article, where a husband calculated it would cost him $70,000 a year to pay for all the things his stay-at-home wife does.</p> 
<p>CRUZ: Machine-gun bacon.</p> 
<p>WALLACE: &nbsp;But what really put IJR on the map this election are its videos, like Lindsay Graham showing what it felt like when Donald Trump gave out his cell phone number.</p> 
<p>With replays on cable news, that got 62 million views. I met with their video team.</p> 
<p>I mean, seriously, have you all got attention deficit disorder?</p> 
<p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes. Yes.</p> 
<p>SKATELL: We're actually looking at the stats on viewership of these videos and you can watch after 30 second the viewership just tanks.</p> 
<p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Plummets. It plummets.</p> 
<p>WALLACE: &nbsp;Skatell was digital director for the Republican senatorial committee when he realized for millions of young people, their front page is now FaceBook or their e-mail inbox.</p> 
<p>SKATELL: I made a bet, and the reason I made the bet was because I was frustrated that there was a large part of America that was being ignored.</p> 
<p>We've had a really amazing month.</p> 
<p>WALLACE: &nbsp;IJR now has a staff of more than 100 and is part of a company that also runs a Republican consulting firm, but Skatell says the news website is independent.</p> 
<p>SKATELL: Our editorial team is completely separate from -- and it's two separate companies. So there's zero conflict at all.</p> 
<p>WALLACE: &nbsp;Now 29, he wants IJR to be the media breakout star of 2016.</p> 
<p>SKATELL: We get e-mails, thank you for showing me this perspective. You're actually listening to us. You’re allowing us to be a part of the conversation. So there's nothing better to me than when someone says they're an fan of what we're doing, and, thank you.</p> 
<p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p> 
<p>WALLACE: &nbsp;Now, this program note.
