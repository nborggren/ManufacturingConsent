                <p><b>HILLARY RETREATS DEEPER INTO COCOON<br /> </b>With <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/29/us/politics/hillary-clinton-vs-elizabeth-warren-could-be-a-dream-match-for-republicans.html?_r=0" target="_blank">the conventional wisdom on the left</a> congealing against the idea of even a symbolic challenge to <b>Hillary Clinton</b>’s march to the Democratic nomination, her team is now publicly toying with the idea of continuing to delay the official launch until the middle of summer. On Monday, the campaign offered <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2015/01/hillary-clinton-2016-elections-114586.html" target="_blank">a sneak peak</a> to Politico, indicating that the campaign would come out of the shadows in April. In what appears to be a rebuttal to the staff assumptions from “a Democrat familiar with Clinton’s thinking,” the news site <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2015/01/exclusive-hillary-clinton-may-delay-campaign-114714.html?hp=t4_r" target="_blank">reports today</a> that “the actual kickoff would be in July.” Clinton would submit to partial scrutiny from the Federal Elections Commission starting in April, the story says, but would keep most of her operation off the books until the beginning of July. The stated reason: the candidate wants “develop her message, policy and organization.” Because the previous 14 years of running for president haven’t given them enough time to nail it down…<br /> <br /> [<b>Additional white dudes retained - </b><a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2015/01/hillary-clinton-digital-campaign-strategy-114710.html?ml=tl_4" target="_blank">Politico</a> also reports that two 2012 Obama digital gurus are at the top of the list for <b>Hillary</b>’s campaign-in-waiting, <b>Teddy</b> <b>Goff</b> and <b>Andrew</b> <b>Bleeker</b>.]<br /> <br /> <b>So who cares? -</b> The money line in the rebuttal from whoever Politico was quoting in throne room is this: “[Clinton] doesn’t feel under any pressure, and they see no primary challenge on the horizon. If you have the luxury of time, you take it.” This should terrify Democrats. If the campaign cocoon is so dense and so deep that courtiers are publicly quibbling in the press about the right moment for the monarch butterfly to emerge, they are farther out of touch with reality than even <a href="http://nymag.com/news/intelligencer/encounter/philippe-reines-2014-2/" target="_blank">previous reporting</a> had indicated. But if this really is Clinton herself speaking through an emissary, it would suggest the kind of stage fright that foretells a risk-averse, bloodless, pre-fab campaign. Sound familiar? Those were the hallmarks of Clinton’s losing endeavor in 2008 and, if the leaks are to be believed, the tendencies have deepened in the past seven years. Clinton’s book tour showed not a candidate who was “rusty” but one who was unwilling to acknowledge political reality. A rusty candidate might complain about being “dead broke.” But only an arrogant one would insist that she was right to say so.<br /> <br /> [“The same old candidates running for President <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ThingsToRunFrom?src=hash" target="_blank">#ThingsToRunFrom</a>” – Sen. <b>Rand</b> <b>Paul</b>, R-Ky., on <a href="https://twitter.com/SenRandPaul/status/560547882256695296" target="_blank">Twitter</a>]<br /> <br /> <b>Deflate - </b>The first hazard of being so blithe as to say Clinton “doesn’t feel any pressure” is that it would not take long for a Democratic revolt to spring up. The presumptive nominee could be caught unawares, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYpYs9GBXwY" target="_blank">like this guy</a>. While Clinton would be hard to stop from seizing the nomination, the effort of quelling an insurrection might be a strain. The other, larger, hazard is that this trend depicts a candidate who will not be ready to meet the challenges of the general election. The longer Clinton stays inside the palace, hiding her treasury and ducking behind her retainers, the harder her eventual emergence will be. She <i>should</i> be feeling pressure – the same pressure that drove <b>Jeb Bush</b> to get off the couch before Christmas. Many consultants make their livings by soothing and reassuring candidates. And with a $2 billion pot of cash at hand, there will be no shortage of people around who encourage Clinton to believe that she is a perfect and wonderful creation who only needs to be more like herself to win. That’s what losing campaigns often do.<br /> <br /> [In the latest Fox News <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/01/28/fox-news-poll-voters-disagree-with-vision-obama-expressed-in-state-union/">poll</a>, only 24 percent of voters agreed with <b>President</b> <b>Obama</b>’s sentiment in the State of the Union describing America as “tight-knit” while 73 percent see the country as dysfunctional.]<br /> <br /> <b>BOEHNER LAYS DOWN OBAMACARE REPLACEMENT MARKER<br /> </b>In an interview with Fox News “Special Report” anchor <b>Bret Baier</b> Wednesday, House Speaker <b>John Boehner </b>assured that a Republicans alternative to ObamaCare is in the works and will be forthcoming from Congress. &nbsp;It’s no secret that GOP lawmakers have struggled in coalescing around an alternative due to what Boehner recently <a href="http://www.weeklystandard.com/blogs/boehner-and-mcconnell-what-obamacare-alternative_826277.html" target="_blank">described</a> as “a lot of divergent views.” Referring to an <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/boehner-and-mcconnell-respond-to-obama/" target="_blank">interview</a> with CBS last week where the speaker was asked about a prospective GOP plan, Baier observed: “You said you didn’t have one. Will you by the end of this Congress? “There are three committee chairmen that have the jurisdiction over the health care policy in our country.”&nbsp;Boehner explained, “And those three chairmen are working together to craft what we believe would be a better approach with regard to health care for the American people than ObamaCare.” “So there will be one alternative?” Baier pressed. “There will be an alternative and you’ll get to see it,” Boehner replied.

The camera in question wasn’t even a camera but an iPhone 5S. Plenty of films have been made with iPhones but this is by far the most successful and first to make it to Sundance. The decision to use iPhones was made to accommodate the independent film’s small budget according to director <b>Sean Baker</b>, saying “It was surprisingly easy. We never lost any footage.” Baker and his team used three phones, an $8 app called <a href="http://www.filmicpro.com/" target="_blank">Filmic Pro</a> that allowed more control over focus, aperture and color, a Steadicam and an adapter lens to attach to the iPhone. “These phones, because they’re so light, and they’re so small, a human hand, no matter how stable you are, it will shake. And it won’t look good.” The lenses were the key ingredient to make the movie look fit for the big screen. “To tell you the truth, I wouldn’t have even made the movie without it,” Baker says.<br /> <br /> Got a <b>TIP</b> from the <b>RIGHT</b> or <b>LEFT</b>?
