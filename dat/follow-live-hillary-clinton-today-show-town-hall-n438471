WE&#39;RE INCREASING BECOMING A  COUNTRY OF HAVES AND HAVE NOTES  AND UNFORTUNATELY FOR MANY OF US WE HAVE COME TO KNOW THAT THE  GAME OR THE SYSTEM OR WHATEVER  WE CALL IT IS JUST RIGGED  AGAINST US AND WE REALLY  DESPERATELY WANT A CHAMPION WHO  WILL STAND WITH US.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; RIGHT.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; SO MY QUESTION TO YOU AND IF  YOU WOULD PLEASE SET ASIDE THE  ISSUE OF WHO -- WHICH CANDIDATE  IS MORE ELECTABLE IN THE GENERAL ELECTION, HELP ME UNDERSTAND WHY I SHOULD VOTE FOR YOU RATHER  THAN BERNIE SANDERS.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; OKAY.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THANK YOU. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; LET ME TALK ABOUT MY SELF-. I&#39;LL LET SENATOR SANDERS TALK  ABOUT HIMSELF. WE&#39;LL HAVE A CHANCE AS WE GO  THROUGH THE DEBATE TO CONTRAST  OUR POSITIONS BUT I BELIEVE  STRONGLY THAT RAISING INCOMES IS THE ISSUE, THE TOP PRIORITY. THAT IS WHAT I&#39;M GOING TO SPEND  ALL MY TIME ON, AND THERE ARE  DIFFERENT LEVELS OF WHAT WE HAVE TO DO. WE HAVE TO RAISE THE MINIMUM  WAGE BECAUSE RIGHT NOW YOU CAN  WORK FULL TIME AND YOU&#39;RE STILL  IN POVERTY. WE HAVE TO CREATE MORE GOOD  PAYING JOBS. THAT&#39;S WHY I&#39;VE ADVOCATED FOR  MORE INFRASTRUCTURE JOBS WITH A  INFRASTRUCTURE BANK PUTTING  PEOPLE TO ROAD, REPAIRING OUR  ROADS AND BUILDING WHAT WE NEED  TO BE COMPETITIVE AND STRONG AND ALSO WHY I&#39;VE SAID I WANT TO  COMBAT CLIMATE CHANGE AND THE  BEST WAY TO DO THAT IS TO CREATE MORE CLEAN ENERGY JOBS. THOSE ARE GOOD JOBS THAT CAN&#39;T  BE EXPORTED BECAUSE WE&#39;LL BE  PUTTING SOLAR PANELS AND WIND,  YOU KNOW, TURBINES UP. WE&#39;LL DOING THINGS RIGHT HERE AT HOME THAT WILL NOT ONLY COMBAT  CLIMATE CHANGE AND CREATE NEW  JOBS AND NEW BUSINESSES. I HAVE ADVOCATED FOR PROFIT  SHARING LIKE MARKET BASKET WHICH I&#39;M SURE YOU&#39;RE AWARE OF, RIGHT? BECAUSE MORE PEOPLE DESERVE TO  SHARE IN THE PROFITS THAN JUST  THE CEOs, AND IF YOU HAVE  CONTRIBUTED TO THE PRODUCTIVITY  OF A COMPANY, YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO DO THAT. NOW, I BELIEVE THAT IF YOU LOOK  AT THE LAST 35 YEARS, DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTS HAVE INHERITED BIG  PROBLEMS WITH THE ECONOMY FROM  THE REPUBLICAN PREDECESSORS. MY HUSBAND GAME IN EXPLODING  NATIONAL DEBT, BIG PROBLEMS AND  PROBLEMS WITH JOB CREATIONS, AT  END WE HAD 23 MILLION JOBS,  INCOMES ROSE AT EVERY LEVEL, THE TOP, MIDDLE FOLKS AND THE POOR  PEOPLE. THAT&#39;S WHAT I WANT TO DO. WHEN PRESIDENT OBAMA CAME IN HE  WAS HANDED THE WORST FINANCIAL  CRISIS SINCE THE GREAT  DEPRESSION SO OUR REAL  DIFFERENCES ARE WITH THE  REPUBLICANS. THEY WANT TO TAKE US BACK TO  TRICKLE DOWN ECONOMICS. IF THEY GET A CHANCE THEY WILL  ONCE AGAIN WRECK THE ECONOMY AND THE INEQUALITY THAT YOU AND I  CARE SO MUCH ABOUT WILL BE EVEN  WORSE. I KNOW WHAT TO DO BECAUSE I&#39;VE  WATCHED IT UP CLOSE AND PERSONAL AND I UNDERSTAND HOW WE CAN GET  INCOMES ONCE AGAIN RISING, HOW  PEOPLE CAN FEEL THEY HAVE A  STAKE IN OUR COUNTRY AND WHERE  WE BEGIN TO NARROW THAT  INEQUALITY GAP SO WE HAVE  BROAD-BASED PROSPERITY THAT  EVERYBODY CAN BENEFIT FROM. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; SECRETARY CLINTON, TO BOB&#39;S  QUESTION ABOUT BERNIE SANDERS  THOUGH. HE LEADS HERE IN NEW HAMPSHIRE. HE&#39;S GOT HUGE CROWDS WHEREVER HE GOES, 20,000 PEOPLE IN BOSTON  AND HE&#39;S RAISED A LOT OF MONEY,  ALMOST AS MUCH AS YOU DID IN THE QUARTER. ARE YOU SURPRISED BY THE RISE OF BERNIE SANDERS? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; OH, NO. LOOK, I REALLY BELIEVE THAT IS  GREAT FOR THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY  AND FOR THIS ELECTION BECAUSE WE WANT TO TURN OUT AS MANY PEOPLE  AS POSSIBLE IN ORDER TO  UNDERSTAND AND BELIEVE WHAT WE  BOTH BELIEVE, THAT THE  DIFFERENCE BETWEEN US ON THE  DEMOCRATIC SIDE AND THE  REPUBLICANS IS A HUGE GULF, AND  IF YOU CARE ABOUT YOUR INCOME,  YOUR FAMILY&#39;S INCOME, THEN  YOU&#39;VE GOT TO LOOK AT THE  DEMOCRATS. I HAPPEN TO THINK MY PLANS AND  MY EXPERIENCE ARE GOING TO GET  US WHERE WE NEED TO GO, AND  THAT&#39;S WHAT I&#39;M ADVOCATING.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; LET&#39;S MOVE ALONG. CANDY, IF YOU WOULD STAND UP FOR ME. CANDY IS A 71-YEAR-OLD MARRIED,  FOUR DAUGHTERS FROM HERE IN  HOLLIS AND WHAT&#39;S YOUR QUESTION  FOR SECRETARY CLINTON? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; WELL, SECRETARY CLINTON, LIKE YOU I&#39;M A GRANDMOTHER, I HAVE MY GRANDSON EVAN SIMON HERE TODAY.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THAT&#39;S GREAT.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; I&#39;M CONCERNED ABOUT MY  GRANDCHILDREN AND YOUNG CHILDREN IN THIS COUNTRY, AND MY QUESTION FOR YOU IS HOW AND WHAT CAN YOU  DO, WHAT WILL YOU DO TO MAKE  COLLEGE MORE AFFORDABLE SO THAT  OUR GRANDCHILDREN HERE, FROM  MIDDLE CLASS FAMILIES, CAN GET  THE EDUCATION THEY NEED WITHOUT  OVERWHELMING DEBT? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THANK YOU. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THAT&#39;S ONE OF THE BIGGEST  CONCERNS THAT I HEAR ABOUT  EVERYWHERE, AND I -- I HAVE A  PLAN CALLED THE NEW COLLEGE  COMPACT BECAUSE I THINK EVERY  YOUNG PERSON WHO WANTS TO GO TO  COLLEGE, NUMBER ONE, SHOULD BE  ABLE TO GO TO A COMMUNITY  COLLEGE FOR FREE. THAT&#39;S TWO MORE YEARS OF  EDUCATION ON TOP OF HIGH SCHOOL. I SUPPORT PRESIDENT OBAMA&#39;S  PROPOSAL FOR DOING THAT, BUT I  WANT TO GO FURTHER. I THINK EVERYONE WHO GOES TO A  PUBLIC COLLEGE OR UNIVERSITY  SHOULD BE ABLE TO DO THAT  WITHOUT HAVING TO BORROW A PENNY TO PAY TUITION, AND I THINK THAT IF WE -- IF WE DO I&#39;M PROPOSING, WE WILL HAVE MANY MORE YOUNG  PEOPLE BEING ABLE TO AFFORD TO  GO TO COLLEGE. NOW, I&#39;M A LITTLE DIFFERENT THAN THOSE WHO SAY FREE FOR  EVERYBODY. I&#39;M NOT IN FAVOR OF MAKING  COLLEGE FREE FOR DONALD TRUMP&#39;S  KIDS. I&#39;M IN FAVOR OF MAKING COLLEGE  FREE FOR YOUR GRANDSON BY HAVING NO DEBT TUITION, AND THEN I DO  THINK BECAUSE I WORKED WHEN I  WENT TO COLLEGE, I HAD A JOB. I WENT TO LAW SCHOOL. I HAD A JOB, AND I ALSO HAD  LOANS WHEN I WENT TO LAW SCHOOL. I THINK THAT IF YOU ARE THEN  HAVING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO PAY  FOR YOUR LIVING EXPENSES IF  YOU&#39;RE ELIGIBLE FOR A PELL  GRANT, THEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO BE APPLIED FOR YOUR LIVING  EXPENSES, AND IF YOU ARE WILLING TO WORK TEN HOURS A WEEK AT YOUR COLLEGE YOU SHOULD GET EXTRA  HELP. IF YOU&#39;RE WILLING TO GO INTO A  PUBLIC JOB LIKE BEING A TEACHER  YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO HAVE YOUR  EDUCATION AS CLOSE TO DEBT-FREE  ACROSS THE BOARD AS POSSIBLE,  AND IF YOU ARE A NATIONAL  SERVICE OF SOME OTHER KIND YOU  SHOULD ALSO GET A BIG DISCOUNT,  AND IF YOU ARE ALREADY A PARENT  BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, WE HAVE A LOT OF YOUNG PEOPLE IN THEIR 20s AND 30s GOING TO COLLEGE, YOU SHOULD GET MORE HELP. WE SHOULD HAVE MUCH MORE EARL EL CHILDHOOD PROGRAMS ON CAMPUSES  SO THAT YOUNG PARENTS CAN AFFORD TO HAVE THEIR CHILDREN SAFELY  LOOKED AFTER WHILE THEY ARE  STUDYING, SO MY PLAN IS VERY  COMPREHENSIVE, AND I THINK THAT  IT WOULD VERY MUCH MEET YOUR  CONCERNS AND MINE ABOUT WHAT  WE&#39;RE DOING TO OUR KIDS, BUT  THEN THERE&#39;S ANOTHER ELEMENT OF  IT. I THINK YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO  REFINANCE YOUR DEBT IF YOU  ALREADY HAVE DEBT.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; SECRETARY CLINTON -- I&#39;M  SORRY, WE&#39;RE UP AGAINST THE  BREAK. THAT WILL BE THE CLIFFHANGER.","smpte-tt":"http://videocaptions.nbcnews.com/smpte-tt/tdy_hillary_money_151005.tt","srt":"http://videocaptions.nbcnews.com/srt/tdy_hillary_money_151005.srt","web-vtt":"http://videocaptions.nbcnews.com/web-vtt/tdy_hillary_money_151005.vtt"}},

SECRETARY CLINTON, YOU&#39;VE HAD A  LOT OF YOU HAVE TO QUESTIONS  THIS MORE. THIS MAY BE THE TOUGHEST ONE YOU GET ALL DAY BUT MANY YEARS AGO  WE SAW ANOTHER CLINTON IN THE  INAUGURATION PLAYING AN  INSTRUMENT OR HAVING A SONG. WHAT SONG OR INSTRUMENT WOULD  YOU PLAY AT YOURS? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; WELL, YOU KNOW ON &quot;SATURDAY  NIGHT LIVE&quot; I SANG &quot;LEAN ON ME&quot;  WITH KATE McKICKON WHO PLAYS ME  BETTER THAN I PLAY ME, AND SO  MAYBE THAT WILL BE THE SONG  BECAUSE IT WASN&#39;T AS BAD AS I  FEARED. ALL MY FRIENDS FROM LITERALLY  GRADE SCHOOL IN HIGH SCHOOL WERE JUST E-MAILING ME LIKE CRAZY, I  CAN&#39;T BELIEVE YOU SANG, YOU  KNOW. THE PERSON WHO THE CHOIR  INSTRUCTOR WOULD SAY, YOU KNOW,  HILLARY, YOU CAN SIT WITH YOUR  FRIENDS WHO ARE SOPRANOS AS LONG AS YOU DON&#39;T SING, SO PROBABLY  THAT&#39;S A GOOD START I THINK.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; AND WISE DECISION NOT TO GET  UP WITH MILEY CYRUS ON &quot;SNL.&quot;  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; YES, RIGHT.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; LET&#39;S TURN TO KRISTEN,  UNDECLARED INDEPENDENT, A  DAUGHTER AND TWO SONS AND HAS A  QUESTION FOR YOU.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; GREAT.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; SECRETARY CLINTON, THANK YOU  FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY. I THINK WHEN I TALK TO MY KIDS,  I TALK TO MY KIDS ABOUT  POLITICS, A BIT OF A JUNKIE WHEN IT COMES TO THAT SORT OF THING,  AND I TELL THEM ABOUT HOW IN  ORDER TO MAKE GOVERNMENT WORK  THERE NEEDS TO BE COOPERATION,  NEEDS TO BE COMPROMISE AND THERE NEEDS TO BE CONSENSUS. HONESTLY IS THERE ANYONE LEFT IN THE REPUBLICAN PARTY, TALKING  ABOUT THE SENATE AND THE HOUSE,  WHAT YOU CAN WORK WITH. YOU&#39;RE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO  DO MOST OF WHAT YOU WANT TO DO  BY YOURSELF. WHO IS THERE? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THAT&#39;S EXACTLY THE RIGHT  QUESTION. YOU KNOW, WHEN I WAS IN THE  SENATE, WELL, ACTUALLY AS FIRST  LADY EVEN, I WORKED WITH  REPUBLICANS TO PASS THE  CHILDREN&#39;S HEALTH INSURANCE  PROGRAM AND TO REFORM FOSTER  CARE AND ADOPTION, AND I WORKED  WITH REPUBLICANS I DIDN&#39;T HAVE  ANYTHING ELSE IN COMMON TO WORK  ON. WHEN I WAS IN THE SENATE I  WORKED A LOT ACROSS THE LINES. IN FACT, WITH SOMEONE NOW  RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT ON THE  REPUBLICAN SIDE, LINDSEY GRAHAM, HIM AND I TEAMED UP TO, YOU  KNOW, TO MAKE SURE THAT NATIONAL GUARD AND RESERVE MEMBERS GOT  HEALTH CARE, NOT JUST WHEN THEY  WERE DEPLOYED, AND THE SAME AS  SECRETARY OF STATE, CONSTANTLY  WORKING TO TRY TO FIND THAT  COMMON GROUND. I KNOW IT&#39;S NOT EASY AND OUR  POLITICS BECOME WAY TOO  POLARIZED BUT I HAVE A TRACK  RECORD OF ACTUALLY DOING IT AND  GETTING IT DONE AND I THINK THAT AS PRESIDENT I WOULD START  LITERALLY ON HOUR ONE TO START  TO TRY TO REACH OUT TO SEE WHAT  I COULD DO TO REACH WHAT YOU  TELL YOUR KIDS WE NEED TO DO IN  A DEMOCRACY WHICH IS SOME KIND  OF CONSENSUS.

Asked if hypothetically speaking, she would consider being vice president, she quips, &quot;Hypothetically speaking, no.&quot;","thumbnail":"http://media2.s-nbcnews.com/i/MSNBC/Components/Video/151005/tdy_hillary_insults_151005.jpg","source":"TODAY","sourceId":null,"canonicalUrl":"http://www.today.com/video/hillary-clinton-on-war-diplomacy-talking-is-better-than-fighting-538594371524","shortUrl":"http://on.today.com/1FS902a","associatedPlaylistUrl":"http://feed.theplatform.com/f/2E2eJC/nnd_56058811","fallbackPlaylistUrl":null,"topVideosPlaylistUrl":"http://feed.theplatform.com/f/2E2eJC/nnd_20381145","mezzVersion":"1","embedUrl":"http://player.theplatform.com/p/2E2eJC/nbcNewsOffsite?guid=tdy_hillary_insults_151005","videoAssets":[{"format":"MPEG4","assetType":"Limelight MP4","publicUrl":"http://link.theplatform.com/s/2E2eJC/lS5AIV_GSSGc","width":"640","height":"360","bitRate":"800000","privateUrl":null,"duration":"384","durationISO":"PT6M24S"},{"format":"MPEG4","assetType":"Limelight MP4","publicUrl":"http://link.theplatform.com/s/2E2eJC/H_qo2iAsPAjT","width":"420","height":"240","bitRate":"500000","privateUrl":null,"duration":"384","durationISO":"PT6M24S"},{"format":"QT","assetType":"Mezzanine Video","publicUrl":"http://link.theplatform.com/s/2E2eJC/bbHdD_52I83J","width":"1920","height":"1080","bitRate":"6000000","privateUrl":null,"duration":"384","durationISO":"PT6M24S"},{"format":"ISM","assetType":"Smooth_1","publicUrl":"http://link.theplatform.com/s/2E2eJC/gGIwOXHYlgJ4","width":"1464","height":"824","bitRate":"3763968","privateUrl":null,"duration":"384.633","durationISO":"PT6M24.633S"},{"format":"MPEG4","assetType":"FireTV-Once","publicUrl":"http://link.theplatform.com/s/2E2eJC/9v_3hrx3E3d8","width":"0","height":"0","bitRate":"0","privateUrl":null,"duration":"384","durationISO":"PT6M24S"},{"format":"MPEG4","assetType":"OnceURL","publicUrl":"http://link.theplatform.com/s/2E2eJC/zI74S3CgizxB","width":"0","height":"0","bitRate":"0","privateUrl":null,"duration":"384","durationISO":"PT6M24S"}],"video_playlists":[{"playlist_id":"nnd_56058811","label":null}],"nativeVideo":false,"autoPlay":false,"hideAssociatedPlaylist":false,"defaultAssociation":null,"duration":384,"liveVideoEvent":null,"liveVideoStatus":null,"hasCaption":false,"durationISO":"PT6M24S","captionLinks":{"requiresCaptioning":"True","clean":"&gt;&gt;&gt; WELCOME BACK TO OUR SPECIAL  TOWN HALL MEETING WITH SECRETARY OF STATE -- FORMER SECRETARY OF  STATE HILLARY CLINTON WITH US  LIVE IN HOLLIS, NEW HAMPSHIRE. WE&#39;RE GOING TO GET RIGHT BACK TO OUR QUESTIONS AND CARSON HAS ONE THAT CAME IN ONLINE. WHAT&#39;S THE QUESTION? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; FROM FACEBOOK, RANDY ASKING  DO YOU THINK YOU HAVE WHAT IT  TAKES TO TAKE ON THE TRUMP AND  ARE YOU READY FOR THE INSULTS? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; I CAN&#39;T HEAR THAT ONE.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THE QUESTION IS DO YOU THINK  YOU HAVE WHAT IT TAKES TO TAKE  ON THE TRUMP, AND ARE YOU READY  FOR THE INSULTS? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; WELL, AS YOU MIGHT HAVE  NOTICED, I&#39;M KIND OF USED TO  BEING INSULT THE, AND HE&#39;S HAD  HIS FAIR SHARE OF INSULTS ABOUT  ME, AND, YOU KNOW WHAT? WHAT&#39;S IMPORTANT IS WHAT&#39;S  HAPPENING IN YOUR LIVES. WHAT&#39;S IMPORTANT IS ALL THESE  QUESTIONS YOU HAVE ON YOUR MINDS ABOUT HOW WE RAISE INCOMES AND  AFFORD COLLEGE AND MAKE IT, YOU  KNOW, POSSIBLE FOR PEOPLE TO  ONCE AGAIN FEEL LIKE THEY ARE  SUCCEEDING IN AMERICA, THAT  BASIC BARGAIN, SO I&#39;VE SAID IF  HE GETS THE NOMINATION, I&#39;M  LOOKING FORWARD TO MEETING HIM  ON HAD A DEBATE STAGE.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; WILLIE, A QUESTION.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; YES, SECRETARY CLINTON, A  VETERAN OF THE UNITED STATES  MILITARY, WILLIAM HOPKINS,  INDEPENDENT, MARRIED WITH TWO  KIDS. WHAT&#39;S YOUR QUESTION, SIR? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; SECRETARY CLINTON, A BIT OF A LONG QUESTION. I&#39;LL PROBABLY MESS IT UP. I&#39;VE BEEN PRACTICING FOR A  WHILE.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THAT&#39;S OKAY.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; DO YOU MIND IF I READ IT? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; NO, GO RIGHT AWAY.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; YEAH.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; ALL RIGHT.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; WHAT&#39;S THE CORE OF THE  QUESTION, WHAT&#39;S --  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; SECRETARY CLINTON, I SERVED  IN IRAQ AS AN ARMY INFANTRY MAN  IN 2004 AND 2005, I LOST A  FRIEND, A YEAR OF MY LIFE AND I  SUSPECT I&#39;LL BE COPING WITH THE  EXPERIENCE THE REST OF MY LIFE  AND YOU GAVE A RANTING ROUSING  SPEECH IN SUPPORT OF THE WAR  POWERS ACT THAT ALLOWED  PRESIDENT BUSH TO GO INTO IRAQ. GIVEN YOUR HISTORY AND YOUR  CLOSE TIES TOLLMENTS WITHIN THE  MILITARY INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX,  WHAT ASSURANCES CAN YOU PROVIDE  THAT COMPANIES AND INDIVIDUALS  WHO PROFIT FROM WAR AND  MILITARISM WILL NOT HAVE UNDUE  INFLUENCE IN THE CLINTON  ADMINISTRATION? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; YOU KNOW, THAT&#39;S REALLY AN  IMPORTANT QUESTION FOR EVERYBODY RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT, WILLIAM,  AND -- AND I APPRECIATE IT, AND  I ALSO APPRECIATE YOUR SERVICE  AND I&#39;M WELL AWARE THAT YOU AND  NOW MILLIONS OF AMERICANS WHO  HAVE SERVED ARE GOING TO BE  LIVING WITH THE CONSEQUENCES OF  THAT. I&#39;VE SAID MY VOTE TO GIVE BUSH  THE AUTHORITY WAS A MISTAKE. I MISJUDGE THE WHAT HE WOULD DO  WITH IT AND I -- AND I AM  VERY -- IT&#39;S VERY REGRETTABLE  ABOUT THAT SO I AM PROBABLY MUCH MORE WARY AND PREPARED TO SAY NO BECAUSE I SAW WHAT WAS DONE WITH A VOTE I GAVE A PRESIDENT SO I  WILL BE EVEN MORE CAUTIOUS. I BELIEVE IN DIPLOMACY. THAT&#39;S WHY I WORKED SO HARD TO  PUT TOGETHER THE COALITION TO  GET IRAN TO THE NEGOTIATING  TABLE WHILE YOU HEAR OTHER  VOICES, YOU KNOW SAYING, NO, NO, WE NEED TO GO TO WAR, ABSOLUTELY NOT. I&#39;M WITH WINSTON CHURCHILL. TALKING IS ALWAYS BETTER THAN  GOING TO WAR AND WITH MY FOUR  YEARS OF EXPERIENCE IN THE STATE DEPARTMENT I HAVE A VERY CLEAR  IDEA OF HOW WE TRY TO SOLVE  PROBLEMS AND HOW WE WORK TO  BRING PEOPLE TOGETHER AROUND  AMERICAN VALUES AND INTEREST AND THAT&#39;S WHAT I&#39;LL DO.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; LET ME ASK YOU ABOUT THAT. YOU RECENTLY CALLED FOR A NO-FLY ZONE OVER SYRIA. PRESIDENT OBAMA HAS NOT DONE  THAT SO FAR. HE WAS ASKED ABOUT YOUR POSITION ON FRIDAY AND HE SAID THERE&#39;S A  DIFFERENCE BETWEEN RUNNING FOR  PRESIDENT AND BEING PRESIDENT. WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THAT? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; WELL, LOOK, I KNOW THAT, AND  I HAVE SAID REPEATEDLY THAT WHEN YOU&#39;RE IN THAT SITUATION ROOM,  AS I WAS MANY, MANY TIMES AND  YOU BEAR THE FULL WEIGHT OF THE  CHOICE YOU&#39;RE ABOUT TO MAKE, YOU HAVE TO BE VERY SURE AND VERY  CAREFUL. WHAT I WAS ADVOCATING WAS  PUTTING TOGETHER A COALITION OF  THOSE COUNTRIES THAT HAVE A REAL STAKE IN TRYING TO PREVENT THIS  FLOOD OF REFUGEES AND TRYING TO  FIND SAFE SPACES SO THAT PEOPLE  CAN ACTUALLY STAY IN THEIR  HOMES, AND I KNOW IT&#39;S  COMPLICATED, BUT I THINK WE  SHOULD BE, NUMBER ONE, LOOKING  FOR A DIPLOMATIC SOLUTION TO END THE CONFLICT, REMOVE ASSAD WHO  IS REALLY ONE OF THE MAJOR  REASONS WHY THE CONFLICT IS  GOING ON AND SEEK A DIPLOMATIC  SOLUTION, AND I THINK TRYING TO  PROVIDE SOME SAFE AREAS FOR  PEOPLE WHICH FROM MY READING  CANNOT BE DONE UNLESS WE GET  EVERYBODY TOGETHER TO TRY TO  PATROL THE SKIES IS GOING TO BE  VERY DIFFICULT SO THAT&#39;S WHY I  SAID I THINK WE SHOULD START  LOOKING FOR THAT.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; SORRY, THE FLY WAS NOT  INVITED TO THIS. WILLIE, ONE MORE QUESTION.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; WHAT&#39;S YOUR QUESTION FOR  SECRETARY CLINTON? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; HI, SECRETARY CLINTON. MY QUESTION IS WHAT IS YOUR  FAVORITE BOOK? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; OH, MY GOSH, MY FAVORITE  BOAR, PROBABLY &quot;BROTHERS CARE&quot;  BECAUSE I RED IT WHEN I WAS  YOUNG AND I READ IT EVERY TEN  YEARS OR SO SINCE BECAUSE IT&#39;S  SUCH AN AMAZING STORY ABOUT, YOU KNOW, FAITH AND HOW PEOPLE HOW  PEOPLE HAVE TO THINK ABOUT WHAT  THEY BELIEVE IN ON EARTH TO TRY  TO GET ALONG WITH EACH OTHER AND WHETHER THEY HAVE ANY FAITH THAT WILL REIN IN THEIR BEHAVIOR AND  MAKE THEM TREAT PEOPLE BETTER. I THINK IT&#39;S A CONSTANT THEME  THAT I&#39;M ALWAYS REFLECTING ON  BECAUSE I ALWAYS WONDER, YOU  KNOW, WHY ARE THERE PEOPLE LIKE  ASSAD IN SYRIA WHO ARE BARREL  BOMBING HIS PEOPLE, KILLING  WOMEN AND CHILDREN WITH NO  THOUGHT AT ALL? I JUST -- TO ME IT&#39;S JUST SUCH A CONTINUING CHALLENGE OF HUMAN  NATURE SO I LIKE TO, YOU KNOW,  DELVE IN AND AND OUT OF THAT  FROM TIME TO TIME.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THANK YOU. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; LET&#39;S GO TO CARSON, A FEW  MORE QUESTIONS FROM OUR ORIGINAL ROOM. THIS ONE COMING IN ON FACEBOOK  FROM SHEILA ASKING  HYPOTHETICALLY SPEAKING WOULD  YOU CONSIDER A VICE PRESIDENT  POSITION? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; IT SAYS HYPOTHETICALLY  SPEAKING WOULD YOU CONSIDER A  VICE PRESIDENT POSITION? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; HYPOTHETICALLY SPEAKING NO. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; SECRETARY CLINTON, WOULD YOU  CONSIDER A FEMALE RUNNING MATE  ON YOUR TICKET? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; I WOULD CONSIDER THE  QUALIFIED PEOPLE OF WHOM WE HAVE A LARGE NUMBER IN THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY BECAUSE THE MOST IMPORTANT CHOICE IS IF SOMETHING HAPPENS  TO THE PRESIDENT, DO YOU HAVE  FULL CONFIDENCE THAT THAT PERSON WILL STEP RIGHT IN AND DO A  GREAT JOB FOR THE COUNTRY,  THAT&#39;S THE MOST IMPORTANT THING  TO ME AND IT DOESN&#39;T MATTER WHO  THAT PERSON IS IF THAT&#39;S WHAT I  BELIEVE ABOUT HIM OR HER.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; I THINK YOU SAID YOUR HUSBAND IS NOT ELIGIBLE.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; NO, HE&#39;S NOT.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; SECRETARY CLINTON WILL BE  WITH US FOR JUST A FEW MORE","smpte-tt":"http://videocaptions.nbcnews.com/smpte-tt/tdy_hillary_insults_151005.tt","srt":"http://videocaptions.nbcnews.com/srt/tdy_hillary_insults_151005.srt","web-vtt":"http://videocaptions.nbcnews.com/web-vtt/tdy_hillary_insults_151005.vtt"}},

Clinton tells story of how she got a job at an Alaska cannery after college. &quot;I was given a spoon and some boots and I was told to take out the insides of the salmon.&quot; The bosses yelled at her in Japanese to remove the caviar faster. Later in the job, she questioned the manager about the quality of the salmon. &quot;When I left, I came back the next day and the whole operation was gone.&quot; </p>

Asked if she had ever been fired from a job, she recounts a less than successful stint at a salmon cannery. Responding to another question, she talks about how her eight years as first lady have helped prepare her for returning to the White House as president.","thumbnail":"http://media2.s-nbcnews.com/i/MSNBC/Components/Video/151005/tdy_hillary_fired_151005.jpg","source":"TODAY","sourceId":null,"canonicalUrl":"http://www.today.com/video/hillary-clinton-tells-about-the-time-she-got-fired-from-a-job-538584643837","shortUrl":"http://on.today.com/1PePdfA","associatedPlaylistUrl":"http://feed.theplatform.com/f/2E2eJC/nnd_56058811","fallbackPlaylistUrl":null,"topVideosPlaylistUrl":"http://feed.theplatform.com/f/2E2eJC/nnd_20381145","mezzVersion":"1","embedUrl":"http://player.theplatform.com/p/2E2eJC/nbcNewsOffsite?guid=tdy_hillary_fired_151005","videoAssets":[{"format":"ISM","assetType":"Smooth_1","publicUrl":"http://link.theplatform.com/s/2E2eJC/3eiaoNpdTylL","width":"1464","height":"824","bitRate":"3763968","privateUrl":null,"duration":"201.566","durationISO":"PT3M21.566S"},{"format":"MPEG4","assetType":"Limelight MP4","publicUrl":"http://link.theplatform.com/s/2E2eJC/M4gfN4gBD2Wc","width":"420","height":"240","bitRate":"500000","privateUrl":null,"duration":"201","durationISO":"PT3M21S"},{"format":"MPEG4","assetType":"Limelight MP4","publicUrl":"http://link.theplatform.com/s/2E2eJC/wTZZWYojURmL","width":"640","height":"360","bitRate":"800000","privateUrl":null,"duration":"201","durationISO":"PT3M21S"},{"format":"QT","assetType":"Mezzanine Video","publicUrl":"http://link.theplatform.com/s/2E2eJC/7sC5rWQT84AK","width":"1920","height":"1080","bitRate":"6000000","privateUrl":null,"duration":"201","durationISO":"PT3M21S"},{"format":"MPEG4","assetType":"FireTV-Once","publicUrl":"http://link.theplatform.com/s/2E2eJC/OHLIAxT0TSiO","width":"0","height":"0","bitRate":"0","privateUrl":null,"duration":"201","durationISO":"PT3M21S"},{"format":"MPEG4","assetType":"OnceURL","publicUrl":"http://link.theplatform.com/s/2E2eJC/_13icKFxqEl1","width":"0","height":"0","bitRate":"0","privateUrl":null,"duration":"201","durationISO":"PT3M21S"}],"video_playlists":[{"playlist_id":"nnd_56058811","label":null}],"nativeVideo":false,"autoPlay":false,"hideAssociatedPlaylist":false,"defaultAssociation":null,"duration":201,"liveVideoEvent":null,"liveVideoStatus":null,"hasCaption":false,"durationISO":"PT3M21.566S","captionLinks":{"requiresCaptioning":"True","clean":"&gt;&gt; AL, I&#39;LL PUT YOUR REQUEST IN. THANK YOU SO MUCH. AS YOU KNOW, WILLIE AND I ARE  HERE IN NEW HAMPSHIRE AND THE  PEOPLE WHO HAVE JOINED US GET A  CHANCE TO ASK THE SECRETARY WHAT THEY WANT TO HEAR ABOUT, AND  WE&#39;VE GOT CARSON IN NEW YORK AND HE&#39;S MONITORING THE QUESTIONS  WE&#39;VE BEEN GETTING IN WITH  THE #HILLARYTODAY WHICH I GUESS  IS TRENDING THIS MORNING,  CARSON. WHAT ARE PEOPLE ASKING IN.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; IT IS TRENDING. PEOPLE HAVE A LOT OF QUESTIONS. THIS QUESTION COMING FROM  FACEBOOK FOR RUTH WANTING TO  KNOW DID HILLARY EVER GET FIRED  FROM A JOB AND IF SO WHY? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; OH, THAT&#39;S A QUESTION. WELL, ACTUALLY I DID GET FIRED  FROM A JOB. I WENT TO ALASKA AFTER I  GRADUATED FROM COLLEGE, AND WE  WORKED OUR WAY -- I WAS WITH  SOME FRIENDS. WE WORKED OUR WAY, WE WASHED  DISHES AND THEN WE ENDED UP IN  VALDEZ, ALASKA, AND WE GOT A JOB AT WHAT WAS CALLED A CANNERY, A  FISHERY WHERE THE FISHERMEN WERE BRINGING IN SALMON AND THEN THEY WERE BEING PACKED TO BE SENT, IN THIS CASE IT WAS TO JAPAN, SO I  SHOWED UP. HIGH FIRST JOB WAS I WAS GIVEN A SPOON AND SOME BOOTS AND I WAS  TOLD TO CLEAN OUT INSIDES OF THE SALMON, SO I DID THAT FOR A  WHILE, BUT THE JAPANESE WORKERS  WHO WERE TAKING OUT CAVIAR  THOUGHT I WAS TOO SLOW SO THEY  WERE YELLING TO ME IN JAPANESE  WHICH, OF COURSE, I COULDN&#39;T  UNDERSTAND TO GO FASTER AND THEN THEY LITERALLY KICKED ME OUT OF  THAT JOB AND THEY PUT ME ON THIS LITTLE CONVEYOR BELT WHERE YOU  HAD TO PACK THE SALMON HEAD TO  TAIL, HEAD TO TAIL, HEAD TO  HAIL, AND I DON&#39;T KNOW ANYTHING  ABOUT SALMON OTHER THAN TO EAT  IT WHICH I LOVE AND THEY WERE  LIKE GREEN AND BLACK. THEY LOOKED HOSHLD SORRIBLE SO I WENT  TO THE GUY RUNNING THE OPERATION AND I SAID ARE YOU SURE THIS IS  OKAY, JUST DO THE JOB. DON&#39;T ASK ANY QUESTIONS AND I  SAID DON&#39;T LOOK VERY GOOD AND  THEY DON&#39;T SMELL VERY GOOD AND  HE JUST YELLED AT ME AND THEN  WHEN I LEFT I CAME BACK THE NEXT DAY, WHOLE OPERATION WAS GONE SO I THINK THAT WAS THE EQUIVALENT  OF BEING FIRED.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; I GUESS SO.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THEY GOT OUT OF DODGE.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; YEAH.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THEY DID.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; I THINK WE&#39;VE GOT ONE MORE  QUESTION, CARSON. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; ENJOY THOSE PANCAKES AFTER  THAT. WE&#39;LL GO TO TWITTER. KRISTIN WRITING HOW HAS YOUR  EXPERIENCE FOR PLAYED IT  PREPARED YOU TO BE IN THE OVAL  OFFICE? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; YOU KNOW, THAT&#39;S A REALLY  GOOD QUESTION BECAUSE I&#39;M  USUALLY ASKED ABOUT BEING  ELECTED TO SERVE IN THE SENATE  OR BEING APPOINTED TO BE  SECRETARY OF STATE, BUT I HAVE  TO SAY HAVING BEEN IN THE WHITE  HOUSE FOR EIGHT YEARS AND, YOU  KNOW, WATCHED HOW YOU HAVE TO  WORK WITH EVERYBODY, EVEN WHEN  YOU DON&#39;T AGREE WITH THEM, AND I WATCHED MY HUSBAND DO THAT. I THINK IT WAS A VERY IMPORTANT  AND STRONG POSITION FOR HIM TO  BE IN. THAT&#39;S EXACTLY WHAT I WOULD DO. YOU DON&#39;T GET EVERYTHING YOU  WANT FOR THE COUNTRY RIGHT AWAY, AND IN SOME CASES NOTHING WHAT  YOU HAD HOPED FOR, BUT YOU HAVE  TO KEEP WORKING TO FIND COMMON  GROUND, AND I LIVED THAT. I WATCHED THAT, AND I THINK IT  HAS WELL PREPARED ME FOR WHAT  LIES AHEAD BECAUSE THE NEXT  PRESIDENT IS GOING TO FACE SOME  REALLY HARD CHOICES CAN AND YOU  HAVE TO BE WILLING TO KEEP  WORKING AT THEM DAY IN AND DAY  OUT.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; SECRETARY CLINTON, STAND BY. WE&#39;RE GOING TO GET BACK TO OUR  QUESTIONS RIGHT IN THIS ROOM. WE&#39;LL LET YOU FINISH YOUR  SENTENCE FROM EARLIER, TOO.

WE&#39;LL GET TO THE QUESTIONS FROM  THE VOTERS THAT WE&#39;VE ASSEMBLED  HERE IN THIS BARN IN JUST A  MOMENT, BUT FIRST, LET ME SAY  GOOD MORNING AND WELCOME TO  SECRETARY CLINTON.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THANK YOU. IT&#39;S GREAT TO BE HERE.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; WE HAVE A FEW MINUTES TO TALK BEFORE WE GET TO HEAR FROM THE  VOTERS. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; GREAT.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; I&#39;LL START WITH YOUR SATURDAY NIGHT. HERE YOU WERE ON &quot;SNL.&quot; LET&#39;S TAKE A LOOK. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; YOU ARE REALLY EASY TO TALK  TO, HILL.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THANKS. THAT&#39;S THE FIRST TIME I&#39;VE EVER  HEARD THAT. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; SECRETARY CLINTON, IT&#39;S A  FUNNY SKIT. DOES IT RAISE A SERIOUS POINT? THERE ARE THOSE WHO SAY, LOOK,  WE GET IT. WE KNOW YOUR RESUME. YOU WERE SECRETARY OF STATE. WERE YOU A UNITED STATES  SENATOR, BUT THEY JUST DON&#39;T  CONNECT WITH YOU. THEY DON&#39;T TRUST YOU. THEY MIGHT NOT LIKE YOU.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; OH, THAT REALLY HURTS MY  FEELINGS, I HAVE TO TELL YOU. YOU KNOW, LOOK, I THINK THAT I  WAS ELECTED TO THE SENATE TWICE  FROM NEW YORK. I WAS ASKED BY MY FORMER  OPPONENT TO SERVE AS SECRETARY  OF STATE. OBVIOUSLY IN THIS CAMPAIGN I&#39;M  FIGHTING FOR WHAT I THINK IS  IMPORTANT FOR OUR COUNTRY AND  PARTICULARLY FOR FAMILIES IN  AMERICA, AND I BELIEVE BY THE  END OF THIS CAMPAIGN PEOPLE WILL KNOW THAT I WILL FIGHT FOR THEM  AND THEY CAN COUNT ON ME.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THAT&#39;S SURPRISING TO HEAR YOU SAY THAT BECAUSE YOU&#39;VE BEEN IN  POLITICS FOR 0 YEARS, SO IT&#39;S  NOT LIKE PEOPLE DON&#39;T KNOW YOU  SO JUST TO GET REAL ABOUT IT ARE YOU HAVING A PROBLEM CONNECTING? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; I DON&#39;T KNOW. YOU CAN ASK ME THAT AND  OBVIOUSLY IT&#39;S NOT THE NICEST  QUESTION TO HEAR BECAUSE I FEEL  LIKE I HAVE A LONG RECORD OF  WORKING ON THE ISSUES THAT I  BELIEVE ARE IMPORTANT TO PEOPLE, AND I&#39;M GOING TO CONTINUE TO DO  THAT, AND, YOU KNOW, I THINK  SOME OF IT IS JUST THE -- THE  IDEA, THAT YOU KNOW, PEOPLE WANT TO KNOW WHAT YOU REALLY FEEL  LIKE, AND, YOU KNOW, I&#39;LL ADD  MITT, I&#39;M A MORE RESERVED PERSON THAN MAYBE SOME PEOPLE IN  POLITICS, ARE BUT AS YOU CAN SEE FROM THE SKIT I ALSO LIKE TO  HAVE A GOOD TIME SO WE&#39;LL MIX IT UP A LITTLE BIT IN THE CAMPAIGN. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; WE JUST HAVE SOME POLLS OUT  THIS MORNING, I&#39;M SURE YOU&#39;VE  SEEN THEM. IT SHOWS BERNIE SANDERS WINNING  HERE IN NEW HAMPSHIRE.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; RIGHT.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; AT MOMENT.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; AND IT SHOWS ME WINNING IN  IOWA, SOUTH CAROLINA, NEVADA AND NATIONALLY SO I&#39;M HAPPY TO BE IN NEW HAMPSHIRE TO TALK TO THE  PEOPLE HERE. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; IT&#39;S INTERESTING TO TALK  ABOUT BERNIE SANDERS.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; RIGHT.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; BECAUSE AS YOU MENTIONED HE&#39;S WINNING HERE, NOT EVERYWHERE  ELSE, BUT HE&#39;S RAISING SOME  SERIOUS MONEY, RAISING HILLARY  CLINTON MONEY FOR HIS CAMPAIGN. WHAT DO YOU THINK HE HAS TAPPED  INTO, AND IS IT AT ALL A  REFLECTION OF YOUR CAMPAIGN? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; WELL, AS YOU POINT OUT, I&#39;VE  GOT WORK TO DO IN NEW HAMPSHIRE. I&#39;M VERY EXCITED TO BE LEADING  EVERYWHERE ELSE, AND I&#39;M GOING  TO KEEP WORKING HARD EVERYWHERE  ELSE, BUT I ALWAYS THOUGHT THIS  WOULD BE A GREAT CONTEST, YOU  KNOW. IT&#39;S IMPORTANT. WE&#39;RE TRYING TO ELECT THE NEXT  PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. THAT&#39;S A TOUGH JOB, AND THE  PEOPLE OF OUR COUNTRY HAVE TO  EVALUATE CANDIDATES, BERNIE IS A NEIGHBOR HERE. HE REPRESENTS VERMONT. I AM, YOU KNOW, OUT THERE EVERY  DAY DOING THE BEST I CAN TO  COMMUNICATE WHAT I WILL DO, AND  I&#39;M LOOKING FORWARD TO THE  DEBATE THAT WE&#39;LL BE HAVING NEXT WEEK.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; LET&#39;S TALK ABOUT YOUR  FAVORITE SUBJECT, THE E-MAIL  CONTROVERSY.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; MM-HMM.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; I THINK I READ EVERY SINGLE  THING YOU&#39;VE EVER SAID ABOUT IT  AS I WAS RESEARCHING FOR THIS  INTERVIEW, AND I HAVE TO TELL  YOU I SEE TWO THINGS. ON THE ONE HAND YOU&#39;VE SAID  SORRY AND YOU&#39;VE APOLOGIZED FOR  THE CONFUSION THAT IT CREATES.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; RIGHT, RIGHT.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; ON THE OTHER HAND, SOMETIMES  YOU SAY IT&#39;S THE WORK OF YOUR  REPUBLICAN RIVALS GOING AFTER  YOU. IT&#39;S THE SAME OLD PARTISAN  ATTACKS.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; RIGHT.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; AND I GUESS MY QUESTION TO  YOU WHICH IS IT, IF YOU&#39;RE  BLAMING THE REPUBLICANS, SOME  MIGHT WONDER HOW GENUINE IS THAT APOLOGY? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; WELL, ACTUALLY IT&#39;S BOTH. I MEAN, I&#39;M SORRY THAT I MADE A  CHOICE THAT HAS RESULT THE IN  THIS KIND OF, YOU KNOW,  SITUATION AND I&#39;VE SAID I&#39;VE  MADE A MISTAKE. OBVIOUSLY IF I HAD TO DO IT OVER AGAIN, IT WAS ALLOWED AND  EVERYBODY HAS CONFIRMED THAT,  BUT IT&#39;S ALSO AS WE NOW KNOW  VERY CLEARLY THE WAY THAT THE  REPUBLICANS ARE TRYING TO BRING  MY, AS THEY ADMIT, POLL NUMBERS  DOWN, SO, YOU KNOW, I&#39;M VERY  COMMITTED TO ANSWERING QUESTIONS AND BEING AS TRANSPARENT AS  POSSIBLE. I&#39;M SCHEDULED TO TESTIFY BEFORE  THEIR COMMITTEE WHICH WE NOW  KNOW IS NOTHING BUT A PARTISAN  EXERCISE, SO IT&#39;S REALLY BOTH,  SAVANNAH. IT&#39;S BOTH, HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT,  TURN THE CLOCK BACK, IT WAS  ALLOWED. I WAS THINKING ABOUT MANY OTHER  THINGS IN MY E-MAIL ACCOUNT WHEN I BECAME SECRETARY OF STATE.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; IT&#39;S ALLOWED, BUT YOU KNOW,  THIS AND ANYBODY WHO WORKS IN  GOVERNMENT KNOWS IT&#39;S REALLY NOT ENCOURAGED TO USE YOUR PERSONAL  E-MAIL, AND I JUST -- DO YOU GET HOW BAD IT LOOKS? IT LOOKS LIKE YOU SET UP A  PERSONAL SERVER, YOU SET UP YOUR OWN E-MAIL SO THAT YOU WOULD  HAVE CONTROL OF THOSE E-MAILS  AND YOU AND YOU ALONE WOULD  DECIDE WHEN TO RELEASE, WHETHER  TO RELEASE THEM AND THAT&#39;S IN  FACT WHAT HAPPENED.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; WELL, SAVANNAH, FIRST OF ALL, IT WAS ALLOWED AND I&#39;VE SAID IT  WASN&#39;T THE BEST CHOICE, AND  EVERY GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL GETS  TO DECIDE WHAT IS PERSONAL AND  WORK-RELATED. IF I HAD HAD TWO SEPARATE  ACCOUNTS, AS MANY PEOPLE DO  OBVIOUSLY, I WOULD HAVE DECIDED  EVERY HOUR WHAT WAS PERSONAL AND WHAT WAS WORK-RELATED. THE LAW ALSO SAYS THAT THE  OFFICIAL GETS TO DETERMINE THAT  AND THAT&#39;S WHAT I DID, AND I  HAVE GONE FURTHER THAN ANYBODY  THAT I&#39;M AWARE OF IN AMERICAN  HISTORY, IT&#39;S NOT A LONG HISTORY BECAUSE WE HAVEN&#39;T HAD E-MAILS  THAT LONG BUT AS LONG AS WE&#39;VE  HAD THEM, I&#39;VE GONE LONGER AND  FARTHER TO BE AS TRANSPARENT AS  POSSIBLE. NOBODY ELSE HAS DONE THAT, AND  BY THE TIME THIS IS OVER, I&#39;M A  LITTLE, YOU KNOW, I&#39;M A LITTLE  EMBARRASSED THAT THE E-MAILS ARE SO BORING IN MANY INSTANCES,  BUT, THEY WILL ALL BE OUT THERE  AND PEOPLE WILL BE ABLE TO MAKE  THEIR DECISION YOU. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; MENTIONED YOUR REPUBLICAN  RIVALS MAKING HAY OF THIS. I HAVE TO ASK YOU, IF THE TABLES WERE TURNED AND IT WAS DICK  CHENEY OR KARL ROVE WHO HAD A  PRIVATE E-MAIL ACCOUNT AND A  PRIVATE SERVER ON WHICH THEY  CONDUCTED ALL THEIR GOVERNMENT  BUSINESS, WOULD YOU BE AS  UNDERSTANDING? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; I NEVER WOULD HAVE DONE THAT. LOOK AT THE SITUATION THEY CHOSE TO EXPLOIT, TO GO AFTER ME FOR  POLITICAL REASONS, THE DEATH OF  FOUR AMERICANS IN BENGHAZI. I KNEW THE AMBASSADOR. I IDENTIFIED HIM. I ASKED HIM TO GO THERE. I ASKED THE PRESIDENT TO  NOMINATE HIM. THERE HAVE BEEN SEVEN  INVESTIGATIONS LED MOSTLY BY  REPUBLICANS IN THE CONGRESS, AND THEY WERE NON-PARTISAN AND THEY  REACHED CONCLUSIONS THAT, FIRST  OF ALL, I AND NOBODY DID  ANYTHING WRONG BUT THERE WERE  CHANGES WE COULD MAKE. THIS COMMITTEE WAS SET UP AS  THEY HAVE ADMITTED FOR THE  PURPOSE OF MAKING A PARTISAN  POLITICAL ISSUE OUT OF THE  DEATHS OF FOUR AMERICANS. I WOULD HAVE NEVER DONE, THAT  AND IF I WERE PRESIDENT AND  THERE WERE REPUBLICANS OR  DEMOCRATS WHO WERE THINKING  ABOUT THAT, I WOULD HAVE DONE  EVERYTHING TO SHUT IT DOWN.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; YOU&#39;RE SCHEDULED TO TESTIFY  BEFORE THAT COMMITTEE. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THAT&#39;S RIGHT.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; DO YOU THINK IT SHOULD BE  DISBANDED? THAT&#39;S WHAT NANCY PELOSI HAS  CALLED FOR.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; WELL, I HAVE TO SAY THAT NOW  THAT THEY HAVE ADMITTED IT&#39;S A  POLITICAL PARTISAN COMMITTEE FOR THE SOLE PURPOSE OF GOING AFTER  ME, NOT TRYING TO MAKE OUR  DIPLOMATS WHO SERVE IN DANGEROUS AREAS SAFER, THAT&#39;S UP TO THE  CONGRESS. IF THEY ARE GOING TO HAVE IT  STILL RUNNING, I&#39;LL BE THERE,  AND I&#39;M LOOKING FORWARD TO  ANSWERING QUESTIONS ABOUT REAL  THINGS WHEN I&#39;M THERE, AND I&#39;M  LOOKING FORWARD TO HAVING A  CHANCE TO EXPLAIN EVERYTHING  WE&#39;VE DONE, EVERYTHING THAT I  ASKED TO HAPPEN, BUT IT&#39;S NOT -- IT&#39;S NOT APPROPRIATE WHAT THEY  HAVE DONE FROM OBVIOUSLY THEIR  OWN ADMISSION.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; YOU&#39;VE MENTIONED THERE HAVE  BEEN SEVEN OR EIGHT BENGHAZI  COMMITTEES. THIS IS THE FIRST TO ACTUALLY  DISCOVER AND FIND YOUR E-MAILS. WAS THAT A PUBLIC SERVICE? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; NO. NO. I MEAN, BEFORE THIS WHOLE THING, YOU KNOW, WAS A BIG CONTROVERSY, YOU KNOW, THE STATE DEPARTMENT  WAS LOOKING FOR INFORMATION. MY E-MAILS WERE ON THE  GOVERNMENT ACCOUNT, MORE THAN  90% OF THEM. THE STATE DEPARTMENT WAS PULLING THEM OUT. THEY HAD BEEN HANDED OVER. YOU KNOW, LOOK, I&#39;VE BEEN AROUND THIS POLITICAL SITUATION FOR A  LONG TIME, BUT SOME THINGS ARE  JUST BEYOND THE PALE, AND I&#39;M  HAPPY TO GO IF IT STILL IS IN  OPERATION TO TESTIFY. I&#39;M HAPPY TO TURN OVER MY  E-MAILS. I&#39;VE GONE FURTHER THAN ANYBODY  EVER HAS. THAT&#39;S OKAY. I&#39;M WILLING TO DO THAT, BUT THE  REAL ISSUE HERE IS WHAT HAPPENED TO FOUR BRAVE AMERICANS.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; WELL, SECRETARY CLINTON, THIS GROUP HAS A LOT OF QUESTIONS FOR YOU ON GUN CONTROL, ON MIDDLE  CLASS ECONOMICS, HEALTH CARE. WE HAVE A LOT TO GET TO AND  WE&#39;LL DO THAT FOR THE FULL NEXT  HOUR.

                    <p> <strong>7:50am ET:</strong> It's already been a newsy morning for Clinton, who unveiled a series of sweeping new gun proposals overnight. Clinton's plan would close the gun show loophole - possibly through executive action -- and would repeal an NRA-backed law that prevents victims of gun crime from suing gun manufacturers. You can read more about Clinton's plan <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/hillary-clinton-unveil-plan-major-new-gun-restrictions-n438361">here</a> from NBC campaign reporter Monica Alba. </p>
